of the stars in it. The names of these are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, &c.‚
(p. 15) twelve in number. Each sign has 30 degrees, 360 in the
whole, each degree is divided into 60 minutes, each of these into 60
seconds, each again into 60 thirds, and as much further as necessary.
The zodiac in the eighth -heaven is called movable, that in the ninth
immovable', like the corresponding equinoctial, because the aqueous
heaven does not move. The sun moves in the zodiac in ‘another
circle called the ecliptic‚ and never moves out of it, though other
planets do. The eighth heaven moves under the zodiac of the ninth
heaven, but only one degree every 100 years, so that its whole move-
ment will take 36‚000 years, that is it will never be completed
because the universe will not last so long. The heaven of Saturn
revolves once every thirty years, Jupiter in twelve years, Mars in
two, the Sun in one, Venus and Mercury nearly the same, the Moon in
twenty-seven days eight hours. Their movement round the earth ³
is combined with this, thus the sun moves nearly a degree every day in
its circuit. Suppose it begins the day with the sun at a certain point
in the immovable zodiac, it is carried round the earth with it up to the
next sunshine‚ but it is not in the upper part of the sign but the lower,
because it moves not in a circle but on a sphere and does not finish
where it began. Thus if the sun and the point in the zodiac coincide
with the corresponding point in the eighth heaven, the eighth heaven
revolves round the earth quicker than the ninth, and so next day the
sun will be one degree further in the movable zodiac. The sun moves
by its motion to the east round the earth, and not by the motion of the
eighth sphere as the unskilful believe.

(p. 17) Chapter 7 treats of the properties of planets and signs and of
the six ways in which all things animate and inanimate are influenced
by them. The Moon is cold and moist‚ Mercury is indifferent, acting
in conjunction with other planets. Venus is warin and moist, yet rather
moist than warm. The Sun is warni and temperate, but its heat is not
destructive. Mars is over-warni and dry‚ and so harmful unless other
signs intervene to moderate its effects. Jupiter is warm and moist,
and the best after the Sun. Thus when it is in conjunction with the
Moon in the same sign it prevents laxative medicine taking effect.
Saturn is very bad and venomous, because it is cold and dry and the
cause of death. Yet it is sometimes useful, like scammony which is
a poisonous but useful drug. For some constellations are so favourable
that if they were not restrained by Saturn or Mars the world would perish
of too much good. The fixed stars are of the nature of one or other of
the planets. (ρ. 18) The qualities of the planets are modified by their
aspect to one another, by conjunctim, i. e. when they are in the same
sign, by opposition, when they are half the sky distant, sextile aspect
when they are two signs distant, quarter aspect when three signs, and ”
trine aspect when four signs. (p. 19) Their effects are also modified by
