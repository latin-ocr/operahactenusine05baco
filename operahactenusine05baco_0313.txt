¹ O Alexander, God has not created any being more powerful Section l)
than man, nor does any other animal contain all those qualities
which are collected in him. And there is no moral quality in an
animal which is not to be found in man. For man is courageous
as a lion, timid as a hare, generous as a cock, avaricious as a dog,2
licentious as a crow, wild as a leopard, sociable as a pigeon, sly as

a fox, tame as a sheep, swift as a deer, slow as a bear, proud as an
elephant, humble as a donkey, thievish as a magpie, vain as

a peacock, unerring as a qata (partridge), erring (and stupid) as an

ostrich, fugitive as 3 ram,⁸ importunate as an ox, refractory

as 3 mule,⁴ mute as 3 fish‚⁵ talkative as an owl‚‘³ useful as a horse,⁷

harmful as a rat. There is no animal, vegetable, mineral, heaven,

planet, star, sign or any other being of the universe which possesses

any peculiarity which is not to be found in man.

Ο Alexander, do not consult in thy actions any one who is not Section E

3 true believer and has no faith in God.8 And the best of believers p. ¹⁴4

knowing the histories and the days of men, the lives of kings, the records
of ancient nations and famous rulers. He must know all the issues of the
expenses; nothing should be hidden from him of what is necessary and
befitting for thee, so that the people should not rise against their subjection
and he not know the cause of their complaints, but he should know how
to pacify them, so that the subjects shall know that he understands the needs¹
os the people, and they will no longer murmur against the king.

(¹3) He must not be talkative or roaring orjocular and insulting to people.

(14) He must not be of those who indulge in wine and ease and pleasures3
he should spend night and day in meeting the people, dealing with deputa-
tions (lit. companies),⁴in considering and planning ; his court should be open
to all who have business to transact. He should listen to their stories, help
their cases, improve all their affairs, cheer their sadness and be patient with
them. He must be of those who believe in Divinity, who trust in God’s
”g law, and follow His statutes.

⁷ Wadds: And above all 1 command thee and warn thee that thou shalt
not make thyself hated by any man created by God in this world. For the
first aim of reason, after belief in God, is the love of mankind.

⁸ For this chapter W substitutes: Ι command and warn thee not to
choose as wazir a blue-eyed man, especially if he is ruddy ; him beware of
most of all; do not trust a man having these two characteristics with any
of thy affairs3 be carefully on your guard against him ; beware also of your
relatives as thou bewarest of the Indian snakes which kill with their look.
And know that excessive ruddiness together with blue eyes is a sign of vile-
iness, and deceit and treachery and envy, essential in human nature, and
grounded in the formation of man.
