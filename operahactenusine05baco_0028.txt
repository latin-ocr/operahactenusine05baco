Secretum manuscripts have gone sofar as to introduce the Hispalensis
preface into the text at p. 68.

There can hardly be any doubt that Philip was French-speaking:
the use of aclze (parsley), heles (p. 97), is sufficient proof, but we have
several Latin words used in the sense of their F rench derivatives,
probus for preux, indiscretus for indsscret, extraneus for strange,
bajulus for builli, citra mare in opposition to outre-mer, and so
on. We are referred to a dissertation by Taube which I have been
unable to see for other proofs by C. B. Hase.

THE OFFICIAL REv1s10N OF PHILIP'S TRANSLATION. ’

The difference in order between the Arabio and Latin texts points
to the conclusion that an extensive work of revision was carried* on '
before the form in which we now have the Latin text was established.
The most important changes, as has already beenasaid, were the
elimination of the magical element in the tenth discourse and the
removal of the physiognomy from the end of the (Arabic) second
discourse to take its place as the (Latin) tenth book. Even if we
had only Philip’s preface before us we might be led to suspect some
tampering with the book, since we find in the body of the Vulgate
text nothing of the ‘operandi incantaciones 'et celimanciam et
geomanciam' of which he speaks (p. 26²⁹) in his dedication.

As a matter of fact Bacon tells us plainly that some such process
of editing had taken place before he undertook to gloss the work.
‘ Et multa exemplaria non habent illam doctrinam, quia stulti non
voluerunt scribere, set abraserunt a libris suis, sicut exemplaria
quatuor que nunc inveni Oxonie non habuerunt illa, nec similiter
multa alia, set Parisius habui exemplaria perfecta' (p. 39³¹). ‘ Item
curn in correccione istius exemplaris habui quatuor exemplaria, scio
quod ablata sunt ab eis quedanrcapitula per stulticiam aliquorum.
Et ideo querantur in aliis exemplaribus. Solebam enim habere
integrum quantum fuit translatum ' (p. 172¹0).

It would be tempting to connect this revision with that ordered by
Gregory IX in 1231 of the ‘libri naturales ’‚ which were not to be used
‘ quousque examinati fuerint, et ab omni errorum suspicione purgati ',
but there is absolutely no reason for doing so.

We have no MSS. which represent this earliest form of Philip’s
version, and Bacon’s is the fullest text we have, but there are traces
of the earlier order in the indexes of many of the Vulgate MSS„ ⁸
in which (only in the index) the tract of Physiognomy comes before
