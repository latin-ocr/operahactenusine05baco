or to one who does not deserve it, is like one who helps his enemy
against himself.

But he who gives the right thing to the right person at the
right time, is liberal to himself as well as to his people. He is
right in his acts and truly politic. It is this one whom the ancients
have named liberal, and not he who gives great gifts and bestows
rich presents to those who do not deserve them. For such a one
is extravagant and spendthrist, for he squanders the wealth of his
state. Β

As for avarice, it is a name which is unworthy of kings and
,of a state. And when it happens to be the nature of a king, he p. 44
should entrust the gifts of his state to a trustworthy person from
among his close friends who would prevent him from being
miserly.

O Alexander, Ι say to thee, that the king who exceeds the
bounds of liberality and throws more burden on his state than
it can bear, verily he will be the destruction of himself and
of his state. As Ι say to thee, O Alexander, and I have never
ceased from saying it to thee', that generosity and liberality and
the permanence of a state depend upon withholding oneself
from that «which is in the hands of the people, and abstaining
srom their possessions. And Ι have seen it written in some testa-
ments of Hermes the Grea-t, ὼευῑ the perfect magnanimity of
a king, the soundness of his judgement‚ and the permanence
of his good name depend upon his abstaining from the possessions
of the people.

O Alexander, the cause of the downfall of the kings of Hanaj ¹
was no other than this, that they extracted too much revenue
from the people and seized their property. The people took
refuge in the Temple of Lightning and asked the help of God.
So He sent a devastating wind against the tyrants which destroyed
them—and parties rose up against them. And the kingdom
became corrupt. And if God had not requited them as He
did, their own acts would have brought about the corruption
of their state and the downfall of their realm. For verily, wealth
is the means of the subsistence of animal life, and an essential
part of it. And life cannot exist after the dissipation of that
part.

, O Alexander, an essential part of liberality and magnanimity p. 45
