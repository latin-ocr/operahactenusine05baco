natural heat becomes more powerful to digest food, so that the
body becomes fresh and full. In this course aman will derive
assistance and increased benefit from joy, wealth, honour, victory
over enemies, realization of hopes, amusements, seeing beautiful
faces, reading interesting books, listening to pleasant songs, the
joking of friends, the stories told by agreeable companions, listen-

garments of silk and linen, habitual use of tooth-bruslies‚ and

eating and drinking, excess in exertion, movement in the sun and

beds (for heat counteracts the moisture of the body and dries it
up) ; bathing in sulphurous or salt water, or cold water in winter ;
eating pungent and fried1 foods in summer, and drinking old
unmixed wines. Likwise excess in purgatioris, bleedings, and
cohabitation. And anxiety, poverty, and fear.2 p. 96

occupation of the mind, excessive love, sleeping onvthe ground,
sleeping with old women, and looking at disagreeable and un-
avoidable sights. But the worst of all are evil thoughts and
pursuing anxieties.) ³
