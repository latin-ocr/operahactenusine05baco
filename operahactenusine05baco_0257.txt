a good narne. And he who considers this as the true object

of sovereignty is right and praiseworthy, but whoso loves sove-
reignty for the sake of power and sels-indulgence, is blameworthy

and in error. To love sovereignty forits own sake leads to
tyran'ny and injustice‚ which brffiak the cord of attachment between

the ruler and the ruled and destroy the allegiance of the people. p. 46
The loss of allegiance causes enmity. Enmity leads to dis-
semion, dissension leads to hatred‚ and hatred to war. And war ε’
destroys law and civilization. And this leads to the opposition -
of nature, which destroys everything.

But when the object of sovereignty is glory and good name, it
leads to sincerity. Sincerity leads to piety. And sincerity
inclines to all praiseworthy things. Sincerity is the opposite
of falsehood. It creates amit-y and high—mindedness. High-
mindedn'ess creates courtesy, which leads to friendship‚ which
leads to liberality and mutual exchange of gifts, which lead to the
establishment of law and civilization, which are in accordance
with nature. Hence it is evident that he who seeks sovereignty
with this true aim leaves apermanent good name behind him.

Ο Alexander, beware of encour‘aging thy lusts. They are
destructive. For lusts lead to the ascendancy of the animal
soul beyond what is necessary, so that the mortal body is
tarnished and the immortal spirit is afflicted. The encourage-
ment of lust causes voluptuousness‚ which leads to avarice, which
leads to love of riches. · Love of riches leads to meanness, which
leads to greed. Greed leads to perfidy, which leads to robbery, p. 47
which leads to the loss of honour and manhood‚ which leads
to strife‚ which destroys saith and love and ruins the world. And
this is against nature. And God (may He be praised and exalted)
knoweth best.

Likewise it leads to the opposition of nature, which is destructible to the
whole affair.

C reads: Ο Alexander, the first sign of wisdom is to incline towards
a (good) name ; and, verily, it is desirable sor one who turns to it srorn his
path. And it is deprecable and blamable sor one who turns lo it with
excess. For good name is the object, and sovereignty is not desired for
itsels; verily it is desii-ed sor a good name. And the first path os wisdom
is a good name. And sovereignty begets the love of a good name. But if
it is sought through a wrong way it begets envy, and envy begets salsehood,
and salsehood is the root os all vices. And the result of sassehood is
‘calumny. Calumny begets ill-will, ill-will begets tyranny, tyranny begets
conflict . . . (as B).
