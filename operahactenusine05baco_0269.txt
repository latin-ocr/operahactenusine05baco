to be healthy‚ a man must take what agrees with his normal
temperament. If his temperament is warm, moderately warm
food will agree with him: and if his temperament is cold, then
moderately cold things will be found to agree more with him, and

the constitution. Therefore one ought to take precautions
against them.
