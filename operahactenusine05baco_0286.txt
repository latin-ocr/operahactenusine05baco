Therefore look for it there, as thou shouldst consult my book on
compound medicines, and drinks, oils and ointments‚ according
to the Schools of Rome, India, Persia, and Greece, and what
I have found out from my own experience and my knowledge:
there is no need to repeat them here. But since I have decided
to reveal to thee every secret that I know, 1 will not hide from
thee this medicine which is known as the ‘'guard ⁵, and it is the
‘mysterious treasure of the sages'. I do not know who dis-
covered it at first. Some say it was revealed to Adam.

There is another party which thinks that Ascalanus, Nasiurus,
Ailin, Dunntanas‚ Kutarus discovered it,'¹ and the philosophers
of the eight Great Sages, who fathomed the hidden sciences‘ of
the secrets os nature and metaphysics, of the void and full, and*
the extremes. And they had agreed together on the 'com-
position of this Great Medicine. And they divided it into
eight parts. ”

And another party believed that Akhnukh had used it by
revelation, and Hermes the Great‚ whom the Persians had

named Ahjad‚ and to whom is ascribed every secret wisdom and
celestial science.

pomegranates and 10 ratls of the juice of sour pomegranates,
