their approach to or recess from the earth. Their effects are also in-
creased or diminished in three ways according to their position in the
signs, that is under the signs in the eighth heaven, which is at an infinite
distance from them all except perhaps Saturn. Three signs are lire, three
earghly‚ three airy, and three watery ; fire is warm and dry, earthssold
and dry, air warm and moist, water cold and moist. Take any sign, the
fifth and ninth from it will be of the same complexion. When a warrn
planet is in a warm sign its heat is increased, in a cold one diminished.
No sign has warmth or cold‚ dryness or moisture, in its substance, but it
has the power of exciting these qualities in other things. (p. 20) Thus
wine, which is cold and moist in substance, warms and dries. Planets
in signs have five prerogatives z House, Exaltation, Triplicity, Face,
and Term. These are connected with each other; the Househas five
times the importance of the term, Exaltation four, and so on. Each
planet has two houses except the Sun and Moon. Saturn has Capricorn
and Aquarius, and so on. Exaltation‚ &c., are not touched on in the
book. Some signs are masculine, others feminine. (p. 21) The Sun,
Mars, and Jupiter are masculine, the Moon, Venus, and Saturn feminine,
Mercury is indifferent. The signs alternate, Aries masculine, Taurus
feminine, and so on. The House is sometimes considered as a division
of the heavens into twelve parts, from the E. horizon to the nadir
(angle of the earth) three houses, (p. 22) from these to the W. horizon
three, from these to the zenith three, and from these to the E. horizon
three. 'The first house is called the ascendant. In the figure there are
instructions for drawing up the birth diagram, and a note gives the
position in which planets are most powerful. (p. 23) The reader is
referred to Albumazar for a detailed study. Bacon then adds a note on
his famous medicine ‘ Inestimable Glory'. Mindsul of the corruption
of his texts he refers readers to Pliny, Artephius, and to the De Acci-
dentibus Senectutis. F urther‚ they must observe the thirteen conditions
laid down in the Antidotary. The virtue of the medicine lies in due
preparation, careful choice of substances, good proportion s, and proper
mixing and irradiation from the stars. (p. 24) Students have endeavoured
to reduce all the elements in food to equality so as to prolong life, and
laid down the principles to be followed. But because of the great
labour and expense involved very few have gone far into the study.
Some however have succeeded, as we have written in our Experimental
Scz‘ence, and we have seen one in our own times, who still lives, it is
believed, in Germany, and has papal letters to prove his age. Unguents
and potions may have a similar effect.
