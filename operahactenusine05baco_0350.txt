In the seventh medicine the quantities are wrong.v ‘Aretim’ is
damin, a kind of cinnamon, ‘amomo' is cinnamon, kurfa, and ‘ cora-
wed ' is raond, al-rawand, rhubarb.

In the eighth medicine ⁴ clavini ‘ is a corruption perhaps of darwam',
doronicum : and 1} dr. each of three kinds of sandal—wood and of lak
are omitted.

In the ninth medicine the ‘dactili Indici recentes mundati a granis
'suis ’ are tamarinds. In line 25, 1 oz. of oil of baisam is omitted. The
variant ‘de luto smaragdi’ in 104² is the right reading.

10612—10722. Avicenna, v, sum. 1, tract 1 (p. 257, vol. ii, ed. Ven.

157¹5. ‘corrumptibili' should probably be ‘ corporali ’. Lines 19—21
are additions. Line 27: the Vulgate text is ‘recipiunt infans et mulier
pregnans’ where ‘infans' is an emendation, to agree with ‘mulier
pregnans ', but the original shows that the translator must have
mistaken the Arabic for ‘ mirror ’ for ‘ woman ' and neglected the word
