And the doer is the all-wise and all—powerful God. And the
accepting by the clement of the influence of the action is the
effect.

The Cause which is the principle (or clement ?) is potential
and the effect is the existent, and it shows the wisdom of the
wise Creator, and the reception by the principle (or element ?) of
the influence of the action according to what it is capable of
receiving, is Justice.

Therefore it is plain that Justice is of two kinds: apparent and
hidden. Apparent justice is that which is manifest from the
actions of the Creator according to its definitions of equality in
weight and measure, since the word equity literally means equality.
The hidden justice is the belief in the wise Creator and His
creation, and finding out His words.

Ι have stated before that a king resembles God in power and
therefore it is necessary for him to try to resemble Him in acts
as well, and to establish among his people such laws and customs p. ¹²5
as are in accordance with justice and divine commandments.
And he ought to believe in them himself, for it is by belief and
saith that Law derives its power. And when the people see that
the king believes in, and follows, his Law, they also believe in,
and follow it, and they become easy in their minds.

And as there are various classes of people‚ the methods of
justice among them are also different. Justice is a word which
means equal division, removal of oppression, correctness of
weights and equality of measures. It is a name that combines
in itself the meanings of all kinds of virtues and noble qualities

and the doer . . . God. And the acceptance of the element is the effect of
the action, and being affected by relation is the element and the possibility.
And the action is being, and the manifestor of the wisdom of the wise
Creator. And the acceptance of the effecti⁴⁴¹ according to its ability of
acceptance isjustice, δίς. ,

Creads this passage a little differently: And it has been found engraved
on some stones in Greek that sovereignty and justice are two brothers, one ·
of whom cannot do without the other. And all things are from an element.
And the cause is reason which has brought them into being. And the agent
the all-wisc and powerful (God). Hence the acceptance by the clement of
the effect of reason is the‘ being wrought' ³.

Therelme cause is the ‘⁴ element' '—the ⁴⁶ possibility” ‚ and the‘ ‘being
wrough ι”ῑ is the “being' '-the wisd= ›m of the Wise Maker, and the

acceptance by the clement of the effect from reason—the effect which it is
capable of accepting—is justice.
