you, namely: treat them with liberality and make them in-
dependent. This is connected with the subject of economy,
which will be mentioned in its own place. The second of the two
helps is the help given by the moral saculties to the actual ones
[i.e., it is a moral means of winning the hearts of the subjects‚
as the first one was 'a physical or material one]. And this takes
precedence of even the first. This, too, is gained by two means:
one of which is apparent and the other secret, The first means
of u'niting the subjects and creating harmony among the ruled
ones is to treat them with justice and leniency. The secret
means is one peculiar to the saints and sages whom God has
chosen from amongst His creatures and endowed with His
own knowledge. And I shall impart to thee this secret as well
as others in certain chapters of this book, which is outwardly
a treasure of wisdom and golden mles, and inwardly the cherished
object itself. So when you have studied its contents and under·
stood its secrets you will thereby achieve your highest desires
and sulfil your loftiest expectations. Rejoice in it therefore, and
may God help you to attain this knowledge and to honour the
masters thereof.
