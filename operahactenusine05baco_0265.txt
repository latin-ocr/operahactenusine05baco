O Alexander, never grieve for what is past, sor it is the p. 58
quality of women and weak personS.¹ And show politeness and
manliness‚ because it will increase thy wealth and humiliate thy
enemies. And order the people of thy country to read, and study
the arts and sciences. And treat generously those who distinguish
themselves in learning and science. Read the petitions of thy
people carefully and reward their good deeds. This will increase
the love of the people to thee, and perpetuate thy name in
history. O Alexander, the Greeks did not acquire greatness and
fame except by their love of knowledge and their exertions to
acquire it. So much 80, that their maidens in the homes of their
fathers were learned in the rules of their religion and their laws. p. 59
They were acquainted with the situations of the seven planets,
⁸ the bows of day and night, with the strings of the bows and their
quivers, with the courses of the moon. They knew how to make
predictions by stars, what hours to choose for various purposes,
and other sciences‚ such as medicine, &c.

O Alexander, do not put thy trust in the service of women,
except the woman² who values her loyalty above her life, and
thy life and thy possessions. For thou art no more than a
mere trus't in their hands, and thy life is at theirmercy. Beware
of poisons‚ for many kings have lost their lives by them. And,
in taking medicine, do not trust to one physician, for a single
man is liable to be seduced. If possible have ten physicians,³
and take the medicine 'regarding the use of which they all agree.
, Thy medicines should be prepared in the presence of all thy
physicians,⁴ as well as of one of thy own trusty servants who
understands medicines and knows the method of compounding
and weighing them. Remember the mother of the Indian king who p. 60
sent to thee some presentS, one of which was a girl who had been
brought up on poison until her nature had become that of poisonous
serpents. And if 1 had not found it out through my knowledge of
the Indian kings and physicians, and had not suspected her to be
capable of inflicting a fatal bite, surely she would have killed thee.⁵

that no inconsistency shall appear either in thy words or actions.

· ⁶ W reads: she surely would have killed thee by her touch and by her
*perspiratiom and thou shouldst have perished.
