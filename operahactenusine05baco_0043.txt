ARRANGEMENT OF THE TExr.

Bacon's division into books is entirely his own, and will not assist
students in references to other editions or to the manuscripts of the
Secretum. The original division of the Latin text into books is also

here printed has however the advantage that its order is not inter·
fered with, and that the division into chapters follows that of the
majority of manuscripts. I have therefore placed in the margin
a section letter, which has no manuscript authority, but is intended
solely to facilitate reference: it will in future be used in this introduc-

tion.
