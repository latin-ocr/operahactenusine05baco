On leis ambassadors, their qualities, and the polt‘cy to be observed Section G
in sending them.

Know, O Alexander, may God help thee to the right, that the
messenger is a proof of the wisdom of his sender. He is his eye
in what he sees not himself, his ear in what he hears not in person,
and his tongue in speaking for him in his absence. Therefore it
is necessary that thou shouldst choose such men of thy court
who are perfect in wisdom, judgement, dignity, appearance, and
honesty, and who are beyond all suspicion. And when thou hast
found a man of this sort, employ him as thy messenger, entrust
him with thy message, and confide in him after that he knows thy
desire. ² And give him no further orders, since thou hast already
examined his intelligence, eloquence and honesty, for probably
he will discover the right course by himself. But if he be not
possessed of these qualities, then let him be a trustworthy and
faithful man, who will not add to or take from thy message, who
will remember thy advice and carefully note what he hears both
when receiving his message and its answer.

And if thou canst not find even such a one, then let him be
a man possessed at least of faithfulness, who will deliver thy
message in the right quarter and bring back to thee its answer.
And if thou seest in thy messenger any greed of gain from the p- 148
place where thou wantest to send him, do not employ him, ³for
probably he will sacrifice thy interest for his own gain.

And do not employ one who drinks wine. Because the
Persians used to press an ambassador to drink on his arrival to
thern. And if he did so, they knew that his state secrets would
be revealed to them. And they used to offer him much wealth‚
which, if he took, they knew that his kingdom was in their hands.

And beware, O Alexander, of sending thy wazir on an embassy,
and thus giving him an opportunity of leaving thy presence, for
verily in it there lies the corruption of thy state. And all the
qualities required for ambassadors that I have enumerated above

he comes to it, the right thing to do will be otherwise W.
