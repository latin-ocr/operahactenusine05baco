At this time the length of night and the shortness of day reach
to their extremes once again, and the day begins to grow longer
than the night. Autumn is finished, winter has arrived. Cold
is intense, bitter winds b10w‚ the leaves of the trees fall, most of
the vegetation dies, and most of the animals take refuge in the
belly of the earth and in mountain caves from the severe cold
and the frequent storms and rain. The heavens grow dark and
the face of the earth frowns. The animals grow thin, bodies
grow weaker‚ and the world becomes like a decrepit old woman
to whom death draws near.

This season is cold and moist, and phlegm predominates in it.
Therefore, in the matter of nourishrnent and medicine, it is
necessary to seek after warm things,¹ such as young pigeons, -

tiveS‚ bleeding‚ and cupping should be avoided, except in case of
necessity. Then the air should be changed and heated‚ and first
of all hot drinks should be taken and the body rubbed with warm
oils, and one should enter a temperate bath. In this season
even excess in exertion, cohabitation, and eating does not do
much harm.3 Because the natural heat withdraws itself into
the lower part of the body and the digestive power increases.
Stomachs remain cold in spring and summer because then, the
natural heat being feeble, the digestive power decreases in those
seasons and the humours are active.

The following is the chapter of the Parts of the Body. Know
that the body has four parts,

First‚ the Head.

When superfluous humours collect in it, the s'ymptoms of this
are: darkness in the eyes, heaviness· of the eyelids, throbbing of
the temples‚ sounds in the ears, and stuffiness of the nostrils.
Therefore whosoever feels those symptoms should take some
Assintin (wormwood) and boil it in sweet wine with roots of
Sa‘atar (marjoram) until half of the water is evaporat'ed. Then
he should rinse his mouth with it every morning until relies
comes. He should also eat with his food two drachms of prepared

⁸ C adds: because stomachs are warm in winter and spring, and sleep is
longer in these seasons, for the nights are long.
