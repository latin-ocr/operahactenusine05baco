whole world, low or high, near or far, is one and the same. There
is no variety in its substance, but there is variety in its accidents.
And its existence depends upon images and forms. Hence there
is no variety in itself‚ but there is a great variety in its forms.
Therefore the first variety which thou seest in the physical world

essence os all that is in this whole world, above and below, the near and
the sar, are one without difference in their essence3 the difference is merely
an accident which is divided into form and appearance. And since the
substance does not change, the cause os the change lies outside it, and the
whole material world which thou seest consists os four substances, and these
are the four elements‚ and out osthese are then born the mineral, vegetaffle,
and animal worlds, and the moving agent is the sphere that surrounds them
all. Each of thern is subdivided into smaller sections, which are species
and kins. 1f1 should attempt to explain or to mention them all, it would
take me too long, nor is this the object of my book. For my real object
therein is to sulfil my promise, and to tell thee some of the riddles os this
great secret. Now that Ι have explained it to thee in what precedes, thou
art sure to know and to find that my word is true. I will now mention
unto thee the virtues os precious stones, for they may prove to be of great
benefit unto thee with the help os God, sor it is needsul that thou know
them.

The stone Bazhar (bezoar). This is a Persian name, and means ‘averts
niissortune’, others say it means ‘tightens the wind ’. It is of a two-sold
colour, one yellow like a piece of wax, and the other olive-green with green
streaks, looking like a sallow piece of leather: this is the best, and it is dug
up in the land of China. It is said that it is found also in the poison of
snakes. Its property is that it protects against all manner of poisons, of
beasts, plants, and minerals‚ and os the bite and sting of insects. He who
drinks of it twelve grains weight will be saved from death, and the poison
will pass out in the sweat. He who puts it in a ring on his hand will be
reverenced by the people and by all who behold him. If it be ground to
powder and strewn on the bite osa reptile it·will draw the poison out, and
even should the place have started to putrefy it will still be healed3 and is
there be ground of the powder two barley corns weight, and melt and throw
it into the mouth of vipers and reptiles, it will suffocate and kill them. And
if some os it is hung round the neck of a child it becomes proof against
epilepsy and any other evil occurrence 3 it saves it from bad accidents.

The pearl. There are three kinds, red, yellow, and black, and it is the
most splendid of its kind. He who sets in his ring or han‘gs round his neck
any of these three kinds of pearls‚ and comes into a town where there is
plaigne, no illness that happened to the inhabitants shall touch him. Who—
soever puts on his hands a ring with a red pearl in it will be courageous and
much honoured in the eyes os the people. Whosoever engraves on it the
likeness of a lion and the constellation Leo with the sun inside‚ and the rays
darting out asar, none will overcome him and his affairs will be easy to
him .
