birds, &c

Lifeless sounds are such as are produced by the coming in
contact of two pieces of wood or stones, δια, and such as the
sound of thunder, of the drum, and the lute. And know that every
sound has a tune,a note, and a condition. And the soul of every
sound is its music. Therefore when the air which carries this
sound comes into motion it also moves its spirit which divides the
various notes and prevents them from coalescing or being mixed
with one another. Then it reaches to its extreme limit in the
perception of hearing, which conveys it to the imaginative faculty.

The sense of taste lies in the tongue. It distinguishes tastes
and flavours. They are of nine kinds: sweet, bitter, salt, greasy,
sour, sharp, astringent, insipid, and styptic.

The sense of smell is through the nose. It distinguishes between
odours, which are of two kinds ε pleasant and unpleasant.

The.,sense of touch is in the hand. Its objects are: heat and
cold, roughness and smoothness. This faculty is situated between
two skins, one of which is the outer covering of the body, and the Ρ· 134
other is,next to the flesh.l

And when each of these senses has obtained that for which God
has created it tocserve the king, [reason]‚ it imparts it to the nerves
which are situated in the front part of the brairi and which are as
fine as cobwebs, and which serve the purpose of curtains‚ or
servants, to the kingg and the said nerves carry it to the front
portion of the brairi. Then all the perceptions of the senses are
presented to the faculty of imagination, which passes thern on to
the cogitative faculty which is situated in the centre of the brain,
so that it may look into them, judge their meanings, and know
their harms and benefits, and act accordingly.

Therefore the existence of the body depends upon these senses
and so does the beauty of everything else. O Alexander, thus
perfection depends upon five things. As the planets‚ on which
depend the heavenly spheres, are five. There are five kinds of
animals: man, birds, small animals‚ large animals, and reptiles.
So there are five things without which vegetables also cannot
exist: root, stem, branch, leaf, and taste. There are five notes in p. 135
‚⁶ music without which no harmony is perfect. And there are five
