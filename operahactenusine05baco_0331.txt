And, O Alexander, this is a Talisman that endows one with
sovereignty and dignity. It secures the submission and obedience
of the people and inspires enemies with sear and trembling. It
afflicts enemies with sickness. It creates love and hatred,and
does many other wonders too numerous to relate and describe in
detail. It possesses a potent virtue of warding off evils and harms.
Ι shall explain it to thee according to what the greatest philosophers
and mighty men in deed and position have entrusted me with.
And I have buried its knowledge among the secrets of the earth
and hidden mysteries. And I have never revealed it to any one.
And I find thee worthy of learning this great secret. Therefore
be happy and truly guided by it, God willing.

Take the substance of Saturn‚ Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury,
and the moon in equal parts, and add to them the essence of the
highest one of them, i. e. Saturn, equal to the weight of all. Add
a quantity of gold proportionate to its intermediate relationship.
Let the ascendant at the time of the operation be Leo, and let
the Sun be in the thirteenth degree frorn Aries, in strength,
aseendancy, and overlooking it. Let Saturn be in Aquarius,
and let the Moon be sound, and in the third degree from Taurus.
Let Jupiter be with Sagittarius, Mars in Virgo, Venus in Taurus,
and Mercury in Virgo or in its ascendancy. But the best time
that can be desired is when the Moon is in conjunction with the
Sun, and Jupiter is in some good and agreeable situation. If
possible let it be when Jupiter is at its height and strength and
Saturn looking at it with a benign aspect, and each one of them
should be throwing its look upon another (i. e. its rays) after
receiving light. And beware of the time when the master of
the middle of the heavens should be of a weak light. And let
the fixed stars be in the degrees of their auspiciousness.

When all the above conditions have been complied with, gather
together all the substances by melting them on Thursday morning
in the hour of Jupiter. Then make out ofit a signet ring. Inlay
it with a square piece of red ruby and engrave upon it the image
of a lion with a black man riding on it. Let there be a standard
in his hand, and let him have two wings, and a crown on his
head. Let there be in front of him six men without beards and
having wings like some kind of birds.

, Having done all that wear that ring on thy finger, for in it
there lies all the benefits enumerated above. Verily herein 1 have
