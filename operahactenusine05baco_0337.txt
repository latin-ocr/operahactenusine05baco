white one appears on the surface of the water at the Setting of
the sun. It remains apparent till midnight when it is fully
<visible. Thenceforth it begins to sink and disappear until the
rising of the sun, when it completely disappears. And the red
stone is its contrary. It appears at the rising of the sun, and
remains apparent till midday, after which it appears and disappears
until the disappearance of the sun. The property of the above
two stones is this, that when thou hast hung a piece of the red
stone weighing two carats on the sorehead of a horse it shall not
ceas'e from neighing as long as the stone is there. And the
action of the white stone is contrary to that. A horse shall
never neigh as long as that stone is on his forehead. And the
latter stone is useful in night attacks and ambushes. Another
virtue of these two stones is this, that when two litigants come to
thee, place the white one on the mouth of one of them3 if he is
right he shall be able to speak, otherwise he shall not be able to
utter a word as long as the stone remains on his mouth.

And thou shalt know the properties of stones which Ι shall

mention to thee.

Thou hast known, O Alexander, from the foregoing description,
in which I have acquainted thee with the action of nature and
the secret of creation‚ that vegetables follow minerals in existence,
and they receive their forms in the same way as do minerals.
As the watery .element prevails in vegetables and earth in
minerals, therefore vegetables receive their forms in the same
way as water does when its surface is moved by the wind, but its
centre remains unmoved. If thou wert to blow upon a drop of
water it shall be elongated and split up and its centre will remain.
T hen, according to the laws of the drop, from being round it shall
become, when stretched, triangular, like the shape of some herbs,
or square or pentangular, or any other of the shapes found in
vegetables. ’

And as the prevailing element in vegetables is water, the
heavenly force related to it, namely Jupiter, is ever engaged in
dissolving water. In short every planet creates that which
resembles it. Saturn creates earth, Jupiter water, Mars air, and
the Sun fire. And the planets do not produce their bodies, but

. only their actions which belong to them perpetually by the help
of 'the universal power which is above the powers of these heavenly
