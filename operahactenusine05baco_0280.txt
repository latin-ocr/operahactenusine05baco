Salt, turbid‚ and noxious waters dry up the stomach and sometimes

bring on diarrhoea. The water of melted snow and ice is also

bad and heavy. Similarly water situated'in barren lands and

marshes is noxious and heavy, because it remains stationary, and

the sun always shines on it. Such waters create bilious humours,

enlarge the spleen and the liver. Similarly with water which

springs from hot and noisome lands, because it contains particles

of those lands. Drinking cold water before food emaciates the

body and quenches the fire of the stomach. Drinking it after

food heats the body and increases phlegm‚ and if taken in excess

it corrupts the food. Cold water should be drunk in summer

and hot water in winter, for hot water in summer destroys the

stomach, just as cold water in winter extinguishes the heat and

corrupts the organs of the chest and liver (B). Tepid water'
drunk in winter extinguishes the heat and corrupts the organs of
the chest and liver and osten kills suddenly, the reason whereof
would take long to explain (A).

Wine.

Wine made from mountain grapes is dryer than that of grapes
growing on level and well-watered lands. The former is useful
for aged people and those possessing moist and phlegmatic
temperaments, and is hurtful to young people‚ and those having
warm temperaments, and thin people. Wine made from grapes
growing on well-watered plains is good for young people‚ and
those having hot temperaments. Wine, as it grows older, in·
creases in heat and softness and is useful for removing cold and
thick humours. And the more it increases in redness of eolour
and in thickness the more it acquires blood-creating powers.
And the more bitter‚ strong, and sour it is,·the less blood-
creating and nutritive qualities it possesses, and it resembles
medicine more than food. And habitual use of wine is highly
injurious to every sort of men. And sweet wine corrupts and
destroys the stomach and produces rumbling and winds and
obstacles. ” .

And the best and the most wholesome wine for all tempera-
ments is that which comes from lands midway between mountain
and plain, and between the moist and the dry, whose grapes are
sweet and well ripened, and not so much pressed as to give out·
the juice of the skin and stones, and the acidity of the tendrilst
