wine which is of a golden colour, between red and yellow, the
dregs of which are settled down, and the particles clear. Such
wine as possesses these qualities do thou partake of moderately,
according to the time of the year and the constitution, for it
washes the mouth of the stomach, strengthens natural beat, helps
digestion, prevents the food from getting corrupted, and brings it
into motion, cooks it, and conveys its purity to the various organs
and cooks it in them, until it becomes essential blood. Then
from it there rise to the brain temperate and moist vapours,
so ’that harmsul diseases are removed from the brain. And,
together with all this it cheers the heart, beautifies the complexion,

used. But just as serpent⁷s poison is the supreme antidote
[to snake-bites], so in wine there is a cure for many severe pains
and troublesome ailments.

stomach, especially when thou seelest a preponderance of moisture
and phlegm in thyself.

To Homer is attributed a wonderful saying concerning the
