O Alexander, I have invented for thee a diagram according
to Philosophy, Law, and Divinity which will inform thee of
everything that is in the world and which comprehends the
government of the world and comprises all the degrees and
classes of the people, and the form of justice required for each
of them. 1 have divided this figure¹according to the divisions
of the heavenly spheres. Thou mayest begin with any division thou»
likest, it will lead thee to one next to it like the continuation
of the revolution of heavens. And as all the forms of govern-
ment, whether the high or low, depend upon the world Ifound
it advisable to begin this figure with the world.

And this figure, O Alexander, is the essence of this book and
the key to thy object. If Ι had not' sent to thee anything else
except this figure, in compliance with thy request, it would have
sufficed thee. Therefore study it with sincere thought and it will
lead thee to all thy objects and will obtain for thee all that thou
desirest, and make perfect all that thou lovest‚ if God will.
