And if thou art laying siege to thy enemy use heavy stone-
throwing marchines, as catapults and shngs, and make use of
poisoned arrows. And if thou gettest possession of their watering
place poison it, and undermine their fortifications. And be on
thy guard against night attacks, for it is a matter to beware of. By
means of night attacks armies are routed‚ and wealth, arms, and
beasts are plundered.¹

And do not pursue a defeated enemy to a long distance, for it
is an act of treachery and cruelty. And, if thou canst⁷ let all thy
affairs be strategetic and cunning, and let fighting be thy last
resource. To do so is more prudent for the safety of honour and
position, and for the preservation of thy army. The Indians are
possessed of cunning and treachery in war, and they have no
bravery.2 And the Scythians have determination but no power,

, and the Dailamites can strike heavily, but are low-spirited and have

no courage. And the Turks are possessed of great courage and
much stupidity, but are suitable for war. Therefore employ
plenty of them and keep thern nearest thy person of all thy troops.

And thou shouldst pit against each of the nation soldiers of their

own kind.⁸ And do not let a small mattter grow great, but settle

it before it attains importance. And let all thy affairs, public or
private, be guided by the approval of astrology, as I have men· p. 155
tioned before.

O Alexander, when thou intendest to tie thy standards, let it be Section L
done in the ascendant of the sign Leo, and let the moon and its
friend be sound (auspicious). And let the moon be in a good
position in the ascendant. And let the lord of the ascendant be
in one of the houses of Mars. And let the moon be overlooked
by Mars from the third house. See that every work thou desirest p. 156
is naturally in accordance with the planets and their houses, and
see that the planets and signs connected with the nature [of the
work] are auspicious, for this is the chief matter. Remember

¹ And if thou assailest castles make thee the weapon which 1 have
invented sor thee, that throws stones from asar and destroys the buildings,
and throws down the walls, and make as many of thern as thou standest in
need of. And they are, namely‚ catapults and instruments that shoot poisoned
arrows, and battering rams, and place upon them the bows and screws, for
it terrifies stout hearts and shakes castles. Is thou seizest their water, pour
into it deadly poison, and guard against it thyself‚ for it is necessary to be

ᾗ exceeding careful W.

⁸ Theresore fight with each of them in the manner that is convenable W.
