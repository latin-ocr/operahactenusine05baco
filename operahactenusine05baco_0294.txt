O Alexander, if thou shouldst see a person who looks often at
thee, and who, when thou lookest at him, turns red in the face,
or is ashamed, or blushes‚² or whose eyes fill with tears, be sure
that such a person loves thee, and is afraid of thee. But if he
shows signs contrary to the above, he is thy enemy and ill-wisher.

Beware of one of a defective make, or having some physical
imperfection.³

The best proportioned construction is ‘of him who possesses
medium stature, black hair and eyes—the latter somewhat deep ⁷
set—round face, white mixed with red or moderately brown
colour, with perfect form and well-proportioned body, head
neither too large nor too small. Who speaks little except on
necessary occasions, a voice neither too loud nor too low,
inclining towards thinness but not too thin. And whose tempera· ‘
ment inclines towards spleen and bile. Such a man is of a
perfect formation. Choose him for thy company. Now Ι shall
describe to thee some parts ⁴of the body separately, the know-
ledge of which coupled with what has been mentioned above will
enable thee to read character. Α

Soft hair denotes timidity‚ coldness of the brain, and scarcity
of understanding. Coarse hair denotes courage and soundness
of the brain. Excess of hair on the shoulders and the neck
denotes stupidity and rashness. And much hair on the chest
and the belly denotes wildness of nature, scarcity of understanding,
and excess of tyranny. Red hair is a sign of stupidity and love
of power.⁴ And black hair is a sign of mildness of nature and
love of justice.⁵ ,

inclined to deepness and darkness, he should be intelligent and
