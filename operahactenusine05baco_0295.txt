quick witted.¹ But he whose eyes are slanting is wicked.² He
whose eyes are moflonless, like those of animals, is rough natured
and ignorant. And he whose eyes are constantly moving and revolv-
ing is cunning and of treacherous and thieving propensities. He
whose eyes are red is bold and reckless. And the worst of all
eyes are blue ones of a turquoise colour, and if there happen to
be white, black‚ or red spots around them, their owner must be
the worst and most pernicious os all· mankind.

Eyebrows of bushy hair ³ denote impotence and unintelligibility
of speech. And if they are united to the temples‚ the owner of
such eyebrows is conceited and boastful. And he whose eye-
brows are thin, and of moderate length, and are black, he is
quick—witted.

If the nose happen to be thin, its ‚owner is impetuous.⁴ And
if the nostrils are so long asto almost enter the mouth it betokens
contage. And he who is flat-nosed is lustful. And he whose
nostrils are very wide is irascible. And when the middle of the
nose is thick inclining to snubness its owner shall be vainglorious
and lying. But the most symmetrical of all noses is that which
is not too long, is of moderate thickness and height, and with
nostrils not too wide.

‚A wide forehead without any wrinkles in it, indicates quarrel-
someness‚ mischievousness‚ carelessness, and vaingloriousness.
But he whose sorehead is of moderate width and height and with
wrinkles in it, is truthful, faithful, intelligent, and skilful. And
he whose forehead is of conspicuous protrusion is taciturn and
prudent.

He whose mouth is wide is brave, and he whose lips are thick
and teeth long is stupid. And he whose face is thin is careful in
his actions and intelligent.⁶

He⁶ whose sace is small inclining to sallow is vile, wicked‚
deceitful, and arrogant. He whose face is long is shameless.

⁶ »Α large mouth betokens courage, thick lips betoken simplicity, and one ·

who has red lips of mean thickness is a just man. He whose teeth stand

out prominently and close together is treacherous, scheming‚ and unsaffiisul ε

he who has straight teeth well set with space between them is intelligent,
trusty, and faithful W.
