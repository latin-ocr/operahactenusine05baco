Avicenna (i. 2'. 2—19) speaks of three chambers to the bath, the first
cooling and moistening, the second warming and moistening‚ the third
warming and drying-an arrangement more like the Roman system;
his teaching being founded on Galen and Hippocrates.

97¹. Philip seems to have misunderstood his text. The hairdressing
and anointing comes in the regular course of the bath ς see p. 209.

97⁸. unguento scesarino confecto de sandel et emleg. In
some of the Arabic texts the title ‘ Caesarian' is applied to this soap.
Other Arabic texts give ‘ short ointment.’ Note that the Arabic word
amlaj (myrobalan) is transliterated emleg.

97⁵ bletes is an O. F. word.

The prescriptions that follow have suffered greatly both in the Latin
texts and in the Arabic, especially as to the quantities‚ but they may be
emended fairly satisfactorily. The weights and measures used are
commonly, rotula—rall —a pound, dz'rlmn—-drachm, and ankz‘a (40
dirlzems) — ounce.

The receipt for the medium contains only one mistake ; the propor-
tion of grape juice is one-tenth of what it should be. Some formulas
substitute the juice of sour apples for those of sweet.

In the first medicine Philip comes to grief over parsley water or
ocymum (eleorangam), and myrobalan (el egaman—-amlaj‚ p. 100²),
and he omits sonie words in line 9, which should read ‘ 17} dr. of musk
and 1 dr. of ambergris ’.

In the second medicine (p. 1001‘5) ‘et galanga cubebis ’ is an intrusion‚
unless ‘cubebis ’ is a shot at ‘ Kabuli ’ or black myrobalan. The
‘ caroble de Babilonia’ is cassia and ‘ virotis ³ is myrtle. ‘ Rabarir’ is
not rhubarb, as Bacon explains it, but tabashr'r (bamboo manna), a silica
deposit in the joints of the bamboo, used as a tonic and aphrodisiac.

In the third medicine Philip gets his quantities right but does not
translate the names: ‘ emleg’ is amlaj or myrobalans, and ‘elileg’ is
halz'leg, Ar. emblic myrobalan. ‘ Darsan cariole ’ is cinnamon (dar-sin),
and ‘ nuce muscata ’ nutmeg.

The text of the fourth medicine is very corrupt. There is no Arabic
for ‘palmitum et ’, which should be omitted, or for ‘aqua salsa colata
bene' or ‘cayrsen '. ‘ Effeti ' is assantz'n (wormwood or absinthe).
This receipt varies very greatly from that of the ordinary texts, and
comes nearer to that in Or. 6421 (D). ‘Fresh Ansaj juice 2 r., moist
Dodderjuice 2 r., ‘ Sares ’ or ‘ Bares ’ juice 2 r., parsley juice {r., endive
juice 1 r. Fresh leek juice 1 r., Fennel juice 1 r., VVormwood {r.,

Fresh Hyssop ὲ r., and Sebestens ἔτ)
In the fifth medicine ‘ escines’ is French lavender (staechas), ‘ber-

forches' barberries: ‘deferat viridi' and ‘trifera viridis’ seem to be
doublets of an Arabic word which may mean camornile or orris root.
‘Cimini’ is anisum (aniseed).
ln* the sixth medicine the text is again hopelessly corrupt. The
