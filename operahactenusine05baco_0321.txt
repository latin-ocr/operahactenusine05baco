lee conduct of wars, tlzeir strategies, and how to avoid their
evil consequences ; llze order to be obser-ved in meeting the enemy, and Section K
the chosen timesfor doing so.

O ALEXANDER‚ do not take part in battles in person, and let the p. 152
great dignitaries of thy court be always in thy attendance, and do
not follow the example of the foolish in bringing together thy
men.2 For verily I swear by God, that whenever two kings have
come together, one of them has planned some stratagem or other
for the undoing of the other. This exists in human nature.
Therefore think of what Cain did to Abel his brother. And it is
certain that envy and the love of worldly possessions led him to do
that.

And know, O Alexander, that war has a body and a soul, and
its very existence depends upon two contending opposites. The
soul of these two contending forces is the belief of victory enter-
tained by each one of the two parties, and their body is the meeting
of the two armies. And no sooner does one of the parties lose its
saith in its own success than the war dies. And it continues as
long as each party entertains hopes of overcoming the other.
T herefore let thy efforts be directed towards rousing the zeal of
thy troops and impressing upon them that thou wilt be successful
and that thou hast proofs thereos. Show it to thern by learned
arguments whereby their souls may be strengthened.

Talk to them familiarly and promise them gifts and rewards, p. 153
which thou must perform 1n time. 3

And know that thou fightest either 1n aggression or sels· defence.
Therefore if thou meetest one who has invaded thee, ⁴¹ let thy efforts
be directed towards securing a strong defence‚ well sortified with
instruments of war, watch—keepers‚ and scouts who should keep up
a look-out night and day. Let thy camp be against the side of
a mountain, or be situated close to it, and let there be plenty of
water and provisions in it, although they mayest not need them..
