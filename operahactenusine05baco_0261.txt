A king should participate in amusements with his family, for
they warm the soul and please the senses and exhilarate the body.
When he indulges in them, :it should be for three or four days, or
as long as he thinks proper. The courtiers should not know of

, this, but should be given to understand that he is privately

engaged in important business affecting them. He should also
have trusty emissaries to keep him well informed os important
events. ,

A king should not wholly avoid eating and amusing himself
with his favourite courtiers and notables‚ but it must not be done p. 52
oftener than twice or thrice in a year. He ought to honour those
who deserve honour and assign thern to their proper rank.
'In order to show his love for them he should praise them to their

If any one happens to commit an actos d-isrespect he should
be duly punished. If >he is of high rank, his punishment should
be banishment from the assembly till he learns better manners.
But if any one is -guilty osan offence wilfully done in contempt of
the royal presence,² his punishment should δεῖ death. Ο Alex-
ander‚⁸ in the books of the kings of India it is said ‚that the cause
of a monarch ruling his subjects‚ or being ruled by them, is merely
a strong or a weak mind. Aesculapius ⁴ says of rulers ε The best
ruler is he who resembles a vulture surrounded by earcases, not
he who resembles a carcase surrounded by vultures.

O Alexander‚' loyalty to the king springs from four qualities:p. 53 .

religious feeling, love, desire, and sear. Remove the complaints
of the people, and relieve them of injustice and oppression. And
