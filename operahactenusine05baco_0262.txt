do not give thern an opportunity of speaking [complaint]‚ because
when they are enabled to speak they can also act. Therefore*
strive to stop their tongues and thou shalt be sare from their
actions. Know that sear of the king is the peace of the realrn.
And it is said in the book of the Indians [Persians B] :s Let thy
sear in their souls be worse than thy sword in their hearts. Α

Verily the king resembles the rain which is a draught from God
and a divine blessing, reviving the earth and those who are on it.
It may bring inconvenience to travellers, demolish houses, cause
lightning and floods which destroy men and animals, and make the
sea to rage and bring about severe calamity. But this does not
prevent mankind, when they consider the effects of the grace.
of God whereby vegetation is revived and sustenance comes forth
and mercy is shed abroad‚ from appreciating the favour of God
and thanking Him for it.

f, 54 And the king also resembles the winds which God sends
as harbingers of His blessings. He drives the clouds by means
of them, and causes them to fertilize the fruits and impart new lise
to mankind3 by means of them He makes their rivers to flow,
lights their fires, and drives their ships. They injure many
things on land and sea, both the lives and property of mankind,
and cause plagues and simoons. Men may complain of them to
God, but He does not make them cease from the sunction
He has assigned to them.

The same is the case with summer and winter, the heat and
cold of which God created sor the sake os fructification and
procreation 3 although barm may be done by the heat and cold of
these seasons, with their simoons and chills.²

O Alexander, inquire into the condition of the weak in thy
kingdom, far and near3 help them from thy treasury in time of

p. 55 famine. Bestow this office on a trustworthy man who is well
acquainted with their missortune, and who is as anxious to help
them as thou art thyself. Because, verily, to remove their wants
is to help to preserve the Law, to comfort³ the hearts of the
common people‚ and to please the Creator.

¹ W: O Alexander, the sear os a king should strike deeper into the souls
than his sword into their hearts' blood.
