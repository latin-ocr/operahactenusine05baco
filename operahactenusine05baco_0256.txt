O Alexander, Ι have explained to thee what I have never ,
ceased from explaining.² And perhaps this will fix in thy mind
what I wish thee to act upon, and which will lead thee to success.
Now I tell thee a short maxim which alone would have sufficed

O Alexander, reason is the head of policy and judge'ment.
It is the health ⁸ of the soul and the mirror⁴ of faults. By means
of it hateful objects are thrown down and lovable objects are
