a Spanish queen, Theophina or Tharasia. The tract, as we know it,
consists of an introduction‚ which incorporates the greater partos the
prologue of Yuhanna ibn al-Batrik (p. 39) and the treatises ‘de
regimine sanitatis ' and ‘de calore naturale ’ from the Western form.
A text of it was printed by Hermann Suchier in his Denkmaler

” provenzalz'sclzer Lz‘teralur und Spraclze‚ Halle, 1883, pp. 472-80,

from eight manuscripts in the British Museum, to illustrate a
Provencal verse poem of the first half of the thirteenth century,
pp. 201—13, which, except lines 313—76, is founded upon it.

Johannes Hispalensis (called Avendeath) was a Jewish translator
in Toledo (1135-53) who worked for Dominio Gundisalvi, Arch-
deacon there. A list of his translations is printed by Stein-
schneider‚ sildisclze OEbersetzer des Mitlelaltem, p. 981.

A possible Tharasia was daughter of Alphonso VI, king of Leon
and Castile. She was wife of Henry, Count of Burgundy, and
mother of the first king of Portugal (1112—28). She died Novem-
ber 1, 1130 (Art de ve'rifier, Paris, 1818, vii. 2). No Theophina can
be found, though this form of the name has the best MS. authority.

This version had a great success: many translations of it in
Italian, German, and the Romance languages are described.

In the best MSS„ eg. Add. 26770 B.M.‚ the translation is headed

by the following lines and preface ι

Hoc opus exiguum regi princeps medicorum
Mittit Alexandro servatus ut ille tenore
Propositoque modo medici non indiguisset.

Hoc mitto vobis ut vos securus eodem
Ordine vivatis ne frustra distribuatis
Res vestras medicis quia non opus est homicidis.

Epistola Aristotilis regi magno Alexandro de observacione humani
corporis directa quam Johannes Hyspaniensis inventam Teophine
Hyspaniarum regine transmisit.

Domine T. Hispanorum regine Johannes Hyspaniensis salutem.
Cum de utilitate corporis olim tractaremus, et a me ac si esset
medicus, vestra nobilitas queret brevem libellum facerem de observa-
cione dyete vel de corporis continencia, id est, qualiter se debeant
continere qui sanitatem corporis cupiunt conservare, accidit ut dum
vestre jussioni cogitarem obedire, hujus rei exemplar ab Aristotile

⁶ philosopho Alexandro editum repente menti occurreret, quod exscripsi
