requires it, the food meets with the natural heat in the state 01

the latter's quiescence, as fire is quiescent under ashes. But
when a man takes food in a state of true appetite and need for

it, it meets with a strong natural heat like a fire which is kindled

up.¹ And as soon as thou seelest hunger thou shouldst hasten p. 76
to take thy meal, sor, if thou delayest, the stomach will consume

authorities on the subject, is 93 days, 23 hours and 2¹5² of an
hour. It begins on the 21st of Azar (March) and ends on the
23rd of Haziran (June). The beginning of spring is called the
vernal equinox, because the days and nights become equal in
all elimes. Weather becomes temperate and the air balmy.
Breezes blow, snows are melted, streams Ηονν, rivers become full,
wells gush forth. Moisture rises to the branches of treeS‚ vegeta-
