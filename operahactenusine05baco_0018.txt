a manuscript attribution is a decisive argument against the supposed
author or translator having any connexion with the work.

A curious confirmation of the possible existence of⁴ a Syriae
version has lately turned up in the publication by DnBudge of
a thirteenth-century collection of medical treatises and receipts
in Syriae (Syrian Anatomy, Pathology‚ and Therapeuties, 2 vols.,
London, 19¹ 3). Among them (ii. 540) is the formula for calculating
victory by taking the numerieal value of the names of the generals
and casting out the nines (see pp. lx, 250). This formula is identieal
with one which exists in both forms of the Arabic text, though it is
omitted in the Vulgate Latin version.¹

It is unlikely that the Syriae text, if it should ever be found,
will bear ⁴the name of the Secret of Secrets. Perhaps the traditional
name preserved by Al—Makin, The Book of the knowledge of the'
Laws of Destiny‚ or the Kitab-al-siyasa of Ibn Khaldun, its alterna-
tive title in Arabie, may afsord some clue. It is quite possible, even,
that the Syriae original may correspond to a part only of the original
Arabic form.

Another passage of Al-Makin, giving alternative names, but
evidently relating to the Secretum, runs thus:

‘Aristotle translated the books of Hermes, an ancient sage of
the country of Egypt, out of the Egyptian into the Greek language,
and he explained in his translation the seiences, and wisdom, and
knowledge which were derived from them, and among these books
was the “Book of Astemganos'' wherein were described the gods
of the men of olden time . . . (and the worship of seven spirits).

‘And besides this he wrote the book which is called “The Book of
Astamatis '’ which treateth of the breaehing of eines, and fortresses,
and kings' houses, and of the submission of kings, and of how men
should make use of talismans and of the knowledge derived there-
from, and of the names which will bring down rain and water to
them in the desert and in the waste land, whensoever they utter
them.

‘ And besides these he wrote a work which is called “ El-Setfitas'’ ι.
wherein he treateth of the knowledge of the stars‚ and of lueky and
unlucky days, and of what it is meet for men to do when the moon

entereth among the eight-and-twenty stars‚ and among the twelve
stars‚ and when new moon is of good or evil omen.
