Ammonius (de Calegoriis) amongst others speaks of the advantages
of classifying by tens, and refers to the composition of ten by adding
one, two, three, and four.

The account of the horn of Temistius (p. 151¹⁶) is found only in
a few of the MSS. of the Eastern version, and no't in the Western
sorni at all. From l. 23 to the end is an early addition, not found
in the ordinary Latin texts, though probably not by Bacon‚ since it
is added by Achilliui, in a slightly altered form, to his woodcut of
the great horn in his editions of 1501 and 1516. From this woodcut
the 110111 was copied incorrectly by Kircher in his Ars magna lucis et
umbrae, ii. 1. 7 (Rome 1646, p. 140), and again in his Plzonurgia nova
(1674, p. 132)‚ in which work an engraved plate is given with sugges-
tions as to its use. No Latin manuscript is known in which there is
a figure of the horn, with the exception of that in Holkham Hau. i'n
the borders of which an entirely fanciful instrument is depicted
(reproduced in plate 151 ofthe Roxburghe Club publication of 1914).
There are drawings in MSS. C and D of the Eastern Arabic text, of
entirely different shape.

The name Temistius or Themistius in the Latin text seems to be
taken from ‘The Book of Astamatis’ described by Al Makin. Our
Arabic texts give Yayastayus. ‘ And besides this he (Aristotle) wrote
the book which is called “The Book of Astamatis ⁷’ which treateth of
the breaching of cities and fortresses and kings’ houses and of the
submission of kings, and of how 111611 should make use of talismans
and of the knowledge derived therefrom‚ and of the names which
will bring down rain and water to them in the desert and in the
waste land, whensoever they utter them.' Budge, Alexander, ii. 384.

Kircher’s note as to the size of the horn (five cubits in diameter)
and the distance at which it could be heard (100 stadia) does not
seem to rest on any manuscript authority.

l. 1 7 ‘ ad nocendum ' seems an early misreading for ‘ advocandum '.

Section K (pp. 152-5), Noli frequentare bella. Discourse IX.
This section‚ which begins a separate diseoume, the seventh, in the
list of books of the eight-book Western texts, is part of the preceding
one, the sixth‚ in that of the seven-book form, while in the body os
the text it is Gate IX. The Latin translation follows the Eastern text
fairly closely, with some interesting variants. In p. 152⁹—12 Philip
gives a literal translation of a passage by no means clear in the .
original. In p. 153³ is a complete mistranslation. ‘W'ar is either
aggressive or defensive ', and ‘ita quod' should really begin the next
