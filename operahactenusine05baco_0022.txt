A second line of conjecture, pointing to a somewhat similar date,-
is the great stress laid in it on astrology, which carne into popularity
in Mohammedan courts only with the Mongol dynasties.- Al-Fakhri
(1258), Archives Marocaines (1910), vol. cvi, p. 28, says: ‘ Sous la-
dynastie des Mogols, au contraire, toutes ces' sciences< furent
delaissees et d'autres y furent en vogue‚ telles que la science des
finances et de la-comptabilit6‚ pour l’e'tablissement du budget‚ et la
supputation des recettes et des de‘penses de l’Empire, la medecine
pour preserver les corps et les temperaments, l'astronomie qui
apprend a choisir les conjonctures favorables.' Itis to be noticed
that the earlier (Western) version contains only one reference to
Astrology, that in pp. 60-2.

A third hint might have been expected from the statement as to
the length of the seasons, inserted in their descriptions. These are
not found in the Western version, from which the *translation of
Johannes Hispalensis was made. If we could trace their source, or
find approximately the date at which they were correct, we should
have made another step forward. Unfortunately the astronomers
whom I have consulted seem to agree that at no period could these

statements have been true.

THE HEBREW VERsmN.

The Western eight-book form was translated into HebreW, as
it appears, by Judah Al-Harizi, who flourished 1 190—1218, and in its
Hebrew form was widely spread, especially in Spain. His text has
been edited‚ with an introduction and an English translation, by

Dr. Gaster for the Royal Asiatic Society‚ 1907-8.
Harizi made a number of alterations in and additions to his text,

some of thern merely explanatory. Among the additions are large

parts of ἓξ 20 and 21 (Gaster’s translation), 23, all 28, 32, and part
of 46, 58, and 62. The most notable addition is the section on

alchemy ἓξ 125 and 128, on the magio ring ξ 126, and on poison
ξ 127. The alchemy is plainly Hebrew and very interesting.

Achab (Achavo in the Latin) is a sea-eagle.

THE TRANSLArroN or JOHANNES HISPALENSIS.

A large number of manuscripts exist of a translation of part
of the Secretum Secretoram made by a well-known Jewish writer, ’
Johannes Hispalensis or Hispaniensis, early in the twelfth century for
