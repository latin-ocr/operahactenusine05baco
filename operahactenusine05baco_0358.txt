THE ETHICS OF ARISTOTLE

Translated from the Arabic (EM. Add. 7453, f. 75V)

The following are the ‘Ethics of Aristotle' which he had-written¹
down in a book, and used to teach to Alexander z-—Every human being
has certain needs, and for obtaining every need or object there is a cer-'
tain way. Whoever strikes upon this way gains his object, and whoever
misses the way fails to obtain it. Man needs the good (or happiness)
of this world. And the means of obtaining it is reason, and reason is
of two kinds : natural and acquired. And learning (or acquired reason)
depends upon the soundness of the rational faculty (or natural reason)
which in its turn helps to form acquired judgement. And judgement,
or the power of thinking rightly, coupled with the acquired action or the
power of acting rightly, conduces to the clearness of perception. And
the only thing that restricts and disables reason is passion or desire.
And passion is of two kinds ε instinctive, or that which is caused by the
hidden and latent faculties, and actual, or that which results from
apparent powers. The former resembles a latent or smouldering fire,
and the latter an open or flaming fire. And just as fire is inflamed
by the wind, so passion is inflamed by desire ; and as fire is put down
by stopping the air from reaching it, so passion is overpowered by
controlling desires. And desires can be controlled by means of sound
and effective reason. And the soundness of reason is known by its
power of distinguishing truths (or facts) from falsehoods, and its
effectiveness or strength is judged from its power of·controlling the Δ
desires and passions. Hence, as reason grows stronger‚ passions grow
weaker, and man progresses towards perfectiori, by which is meant the
power of thinking and acting rightly. And natural wisdom, or the
power of knowing the right, is· not perfect without actual wisdoin, or
the power of acting rightly. And when natural judgement. preponderates
over natural passions‚ the latter have little power to influence man’s
actions, except in case of his appetites, and these are regulated by
acquired reason (or judgernent) and acquired actions (or the right way
of conducting oneself learnt afterwards).
