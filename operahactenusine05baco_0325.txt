Ο Alexander, count the numbers of the letters of the names ot
the commanders of both the armies, according to the above table.
Then divide the total of each name by 9, and keep in thy mind
the remainder of each. If the number is divided equally and
nothing remain then take 9 for the remainder. Then predict
according to the following table, which is correct and unfailing,
and do thou note it well.²

If the remainders are 1 and 9, 1 will overcome 9. If 1 and 8,
eight beats one, 1 and 7, one beats‚ 1 and 6, six beats‚ 1 andi 5,
one beats‚ 1 and 4, four beats‚ 1 and 3, one beats‚ 1 and 2, two
beaw, 1 and 1, the aggressor wins.

Second Table.

If 2 and 9 are left, the 9 shall be victorious. If 2 and 8, two
will overcome the eight, 2 and 7, seven will overcome the two, 2
and 6, two will overcome the six, 2 and 5, five will overcome the
two, 2 and 4, two will overcome the four, 2 and 3, three will over-
come the two, 2 and 2, the aggressor shall be victorious, 2 and 1, f. 57
two shall overcome the one. ·

is that thou goest not to fight thine enemy until thou hast found by this
calculation that thou art sure to conquer. And if it be not advantageous to
thee, then calculate the names of thy servants, and appoint over the army
only the one who according to these calculations is sure to win. And in
such manner shalt thou reckon: get the sum of the names of the generals.
And os thy name, keep the sum of each of them, then from the sum-total of
each of these names subtract as many nines as it contains, and put aside the
remainder under nine that is left, and thus proceed with the second name;
whatever remains less than nine, or nine, of the second put also aside.
Then look at the table which 1 have written sor thee, and compare it with
the remainder os the sums of the two names: what thou findest therein
believe, for it is true, and by the help os the Lord thou shalt never be led
astnay W.
