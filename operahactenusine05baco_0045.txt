be seen that both in the Eastern and vthe Western forms the list is
identically the same, varying only in the distribution into seven,
eight, or ten discourses. It is evident that its place in the interior
of the work preserved it from interpolation to be an important
evidence of the original form of the Secretum.

D1SCOURSE I.
Section f.

T-his section is undoubtedly of Greek origin—either Byzantine
or Alexandrian, though we can trace no exact equivalent for it.
The classification of the four kinds of kings is traditionally attributed
to Pythagoras, and the whole first chapter of the Section is but an
amplification of the virtues of a king as described by Cicero— ro
rege Dei. 9. 26 ‘Fortem‚ justum, severum, gravem, magnanimum,
largum, beneficum, et liberalem esse, hae sunt regiae laudes.’

Perhaps the most interesting feature of this section is the introduc-
tion of a quotation from an otherwise unknown Hermetic book.
Several others are scattered through the Smetmn, and they will
be brought together in a separate note. Personally I consider thern
to be of Alexandrian origin.

The story of the revolt of the people of Hanayaj (which I cannot
identify) has been much enlarged by the introduction of the Divine
interposition (p. 44²²-²³)‚ which was not in the original.

A comparison of the Arabic and Latin texts from this point on
will reveal a tendency on the part of Philip to round off his sentences
and amplify thern without much regard to his text.

DISCOURSE II.
Sections g-t 5 v.

This discourse, which runs from p. 47 to p. 110, and from p. 164
to p. 172 in the Latin text, includes in its original form only fifteen
of them, i. e. to p. 62. The remainder of it consists of interpolations
which in the Western text have in some cases been added at the end
of the original work, in others from no part of it. It is this distinc-
tion which has led me to the conclusion that the Western text is not
an abbreviation, as Professor Foerster thought it, but one which is
itself an enlargement of the original text. The study of the ‘gate’
of- Physiognomy, to which Professor Foerster restricted himself,
would indeed by itself justify his conclusion, 'but the differences
between the two forms of the Physiognomy are quite as compatible
