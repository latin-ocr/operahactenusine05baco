harm thy interests and will turn away the hopes that people have
in thee into other directions too numerous to describe. If thou
canst not find five ministers with the qualities described above,

anything is made of three numbers. The medium is fiye, and
the most perfect is seven. For the heavens are seven and so are
the earths z the planets are seven and so are the days of the week:
(the revolutions of the moon are seven. R), the days of joy are
seven, and so are those of sorrow. And the number seven is
found in many other things too numerous to relate.

One of the methods of trying thy minister is this. Give him to
think that thou stan-dest in need of money. If he counsel thee to
draw upon thy treasury, and make this to appear easy to thee,' then ⁶
verily he is no treasure for thee. And if he suggest to thee 'the
advisability of extracting money from the people‚ this policy is of
the worst kind, and will lead thee to incur the hatred of the
people.² And if he offer to thee his own wealth‚ and entreat thee
to make use of it, be certain that he is truly loyal to thee.³ Be
grateful to him and value his services. For verily money is loved
by all souls, and no one is willing to sacrifice it for thee unless he
prefer thee to himself.

Also examine thy ministers by giving them gifts and presentS.
And whomsoever thou findest greedy thereos he shall be of no
good to thee. Because the minister whose sole object is the
acquirement of wealth serves thee for his own gain and not for thy
sake. Verily the love of gain corrupts judgement, and is an in-
curable disease. For the more he gains the more he wantS.
And the greed of a minister leads to the ruin of the state sor
many reasons. For such a minister can be easily led by thy
enemy by being bribed to destroy thee. .

It is advisable sor tliis reason not to allow a minister to leave
thy presence, and to bind him not to hold any communication-
with any other king—either by correspondence or through mes· ·
sengers. And if thou findest a minister doing 50, reproach him

treasured it up W. ,
