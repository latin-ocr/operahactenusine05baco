lighten the body, kindle up the heat of the stomach, and rouse
the soul.¹

Then let there be placed before thee various kinds of eatables‚
and eat the kind on which thy choice falls and to which thy
appetite is excited.² Then, if possible, do not exceed the bounds,
and do not eat to repletion. That is the desire and aim. But
is it is not possible for thee, then observe moderatiori, and eat
at first what should be eaten at first, and last, what ought to be
caten last. As, for instance, when one wishes to take a soft and
a binding diet at one and the same meal, he should take the soft
first and the binding one afterwards, in order to make a free
passage for the food after its digestion 3 but if the binding food
is taken first and the soft one afterwards there is no free passage
and both foods become corrupted.⁸

Similarly if he takes at one and the same meal food which is
quickly digestible and food which is slow of digestion, he should
take the food which is slow of digestion into the bottom of his
stomach, because the bottom of the stomach. is warmer and
stronger in digesting on account of its being formed of a stronger p. 72
and warmer substance4 and being situated closer to the liver,
which is a cooking agent. The upper part of the stomach is
sinewy‚ cold and weak in digesting, so that when food rises to
the top of the stomach it is not digested speedily. Another
point in eating is to withhold thy hand when there is still some
of thy appetite left. Because eating to satiety straitens the
soul⁵ and causes the food to remain lying in the bottom of the
stomach.

He should also restrain himself from drinking immediately
after food habitually.⁶ Because water taken soon after eating
cools the stomach, extinguishes the heat of the appetite, and
corrupts the food, and brings on indigestion‚ which is the worst
os bodily afflictions and is named ‘deferred poison '. But if it is
found necessary to drink water, either on account of the hot
