be forfeited. And if the culprit happens to die¹ a natural death
according as is destined, and is not slain, then he draws on him-
self the wrath of God all the more, and is consigned to perpetual
punishment and pain, unless he dies repentant.

O Alexander in all cases where punishment· is necessary, you

μ will find that a long imprisonment or a severe chastisement is

sufficient, and this I need not explain 1n detail. But in exacting
penalties, follow the writings of thy divine ancestors and thine
actions will always be right. O Alexander, consider thy weakest

' enemy as if he were the s'trongest. Do not despise him, because

many a weak and contemptible enemy becomes a powerful one,
whose treatment is difficult and whose disease is baffling.

O Alexander, beware of perfidy, for it is the nature of fooh'sh
children. Its consequence is evil, and although it may achieve
some little, it depriveth of much. Thus beware of breaking thy
promises and violating thy covenants. For² that is an extreme
form of treachery, a failure of manliness, and a destroyer of much
worldly success, which Ι have previously warned thee to avoid.

O Alexander, thou knowest that on thy right hand and on thy
left are two spirits who reckon against thee thy smallest and
greatest words and actions, whereof they inform thy Maker, Who
knoweth best. Therefore guide thy conduct³ in the knowledge
that all thy secret and public deeds are laid before thy Maker.

O Alexander, what can compel a king to take an oath? There
is no hand over a king's hand except that of God. Therefore
never make use of an oath‚ unless even to be cut with a knife
would not make you break it. For verfly, Inakh, Safoor, and
Hananij' lost their kingdoms simply through breaking their oaths
for the sake of worldly goods, and their government perished
through their excessive use of force.

The breaking of agreements in state policy is required in
certain situations, as I have before mentioned. This is not the
place to explain these, but further on in this book I will refer to
the'm briefiy. Ponder thern and thou shalt be successful, if
God will.

¹ W: suddenly, he remains sor ever in punishment and pain, because {he

Lord is wroth with him.
² W: this is an important part of thy Faith os which 1 have spoken to

thee before.
³ W: so that he who beholds it may rejoice and make it known to thy

Creator.
