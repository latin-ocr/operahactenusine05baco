Datque mathematicos comburi theologia.

He then passes to the discussion of free will, showing its compati-
bility with astrological predictions: these latter only showing the
surroundings in which persons will be living at a fixed time and
place, and the likelihood of their actions taking a definite direction
in consequence. On p. 6 he gives the titles of five illicit books as
examples, and tells us that he has known very great men, not only
clerks but learned princes, engaged in their study. He goes on to
describe several forms of popular magic. Among these is the art of
seeing such things as stolen goods by looking on polished surfaces
such as the finger-nails of bewitched virgin youths, basins, sword-
blades‚ and the blade-bones of rams. The art of geomancy and of
making figures in sand is next referred t0, and Bacon describes how
in lands oversea geomancers sit in the market·places and answer the
questions of all comers. Lawful divination is his next subject, which
includes vaticination from natural objects, such as the Comet of
1264 (which preceded the death of Simon de Montfort), with its
results. He describes the phenomena which accompany a total
eclipse‚ which he had evidently seen.

In his astrological section we have an account of the movements
of the spheres‚ the apparent motion of the sun, the properties of the
planets (with allusions to rhubarb and scammony), the aspects of the
planets (conjunction, trine, quartile, sextile, and opposition), the signs
of t-he zodiac and their qualities, and the houses of the planets. The
‘dignities’ of the planets are given as domus, exultacio, triplicitas,
facies, and terminus. The order here varies from that in the Opus
Maju-s‚ i. 2 58, where a terminus has twice, the dignity of a facies (see
also i. 378, 389), this definition being borrowed from Grosseteste's
de impressionibus (Philos. Works, ed. Bauer, p. 42). The signs and
planets are also either masculine or feminine. Lastly the scheme
for the solution of any question is described.

Bacon closes the tract by a short eulogy of the universal medicine
to be found in the body of the Secretum, p. 99.
