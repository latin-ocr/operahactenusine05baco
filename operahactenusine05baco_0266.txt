O Alexander, guard thy noble immortal soul, for verily, it is
a trust with thee. And do not be like the ignorant people of
the temples who follow the letter¹ without understanding its
meaning. v, ,

And if it may be possible for thee do not rise nor sit nor eat
nor drink nor do anything except at the time chosen by astrology‚
for thus you will prosper 3 because, verily, God has not created
anything uselessly. And it was through it that the learned Plato
carne to know the situations of the parts of compounds with the
difference of their colours [qualities] at their conception according
to their composing relations. Hence he discovered the art of
painting² on silk and drawing of pictures. And do not listen to
those fools who say that the science of astrology is ³ false and use· .
less, and that one who predicts future events by means of astrology
is an impostor. And I say that it is necessary to pay due regard
to astrology. For although man cannot avoid his fate, yet by
knowing it beforehand he prepares himself for it and makes use
of the remedies calculated to avert it. As people provide them-
selves with shester, fuel, furs, &c., to defend themselves against
the rigours of coming winter. Similarly to meet the hot weather
they provide themselves with cooling things. And against the
years of famine they collect provisions and store them up; like-
wise for sear of strife they emigrate to anoth'er country. There·
is another advantage, and that is that when men know of events
before they happen, they can ask God to avert thern, and before ⁴
the crisis they may pray to God and humble themselves before

2 Him, and ask for forgiveness and pardon, and repent and fast and

pray and beseech Almighty God to spare them.⁴

¹ A ε who yield obedience.

2 W: the dibaj (fringe) and all- the Ideas.

3 W: a secret knowledge which no one can obtain} or the opinions of
those who believe that this science gives salse prognostications and who do
not know that it carne first of all by inspiration of God.

⁴ W and the Hebrew insert here: Alexander, honour thy wazlr more
than thyself‚ and seek his advice in small or in great matters, and keep him
near thy council chamber, for he is thy honour before all the nobles and thy
friend in private, and thy protector against evil-doers. Take, -for example,
the king and queen [wazlr in the Eastern game] in chess, when he is with
her, and when he is separated from her. This is the best illustration of my
meaning ; and do not believe that the government can stand without a wazir,
for that is absurd. Do not neglect to ponder on these examples, so that·

you may be guided might, is God please. They then proceed at once to
Book 111.
