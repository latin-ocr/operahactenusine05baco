annotation. It is the last chapter of the Secretum in its original

form, lines 3-6 being the final paragraph of the tenth Discourse.
Section A (pp. 12 3—6)‚ de justicia. Discourse III. This section

seems to have been the whole of Discourse III of the original Secre-

tum, though in the Vulgate Latin text section B, >‘ de exitu rerum ’ἱ

(pp. 127—32)‚ is included in the third Book : in both the West'ern and
Eastern texts it forms part of Discourse IV. The Western text is
much shorter than the Eastern‚ the passage between 124⁶ and 12 5¹⁰
having been inserted. As will* be seen from the variants in the Arabic
version thispassage has been the subject of considerable revision z it
is an attempt to state, in philosophical terms. the relationship of
Justice to the Deity. Philip, if the text before him at all resembled
any we have, has considerably enlarged the argument, and in¹ some
places misunderstood it, and Bacon in his glosses entirely misses
the original meaning.

Apart from this passage, the section is most probably of Persian
origin. Lines 12 3⁰⁶⁶ sqq. may be paralleled with the following from the
Praz'ries d'Or, ii. 155 : ‘Ardeshir disait aussi: Un roi doit donner
un libre cours'a sa justice. La justice est la source de tous les biens ;

c’est une citadelle elevee pour la defense de l’Etat et 16 maintien de ι

l'ordre 3 le de'ni de justice est le premier symptome de la ruine d’un
pays.' The inscription in Syriae (p. 124⁵) and the counsels of
Ardeshir to his son Sabur on his accession to the throne, from the
same work (ii. 162), also run on similar lines : ‘Sachez, ὃ mon fils,
que la religion et‘la royaut'e sont deux soeurs qui ne peuvent existet
l'une sans l'autre . . .' In p. 124³ and 124²⁰ the Vulgate text gives
the correct reading.

The most interesting part of the section is the philosophie diagram,
divided into degrees, showing the government of the world. The
proper arrangement of the diagram is shown in the note on p. 126,
but Philip's text evidently was not* drawn up in that form, and no

Latin text known to me has it. As a result Bacon’s gloss is altogether -

beside the point. The form in which this collection of sayings appears
is usually that of Aristotle's grave. Hunain ibn Ishak, in his Aphor-
isms’ofphilosophers and physic-iaus, thus recounts it. ‘ When Aristotle
carne to die he gave an order that an octagonal building should be
raised over his tomb‚ and that on the eight sides of it eight mottoes
touching all that serves the advantage of mankind should be written.

(1) The world is a garden whose edge is fortune. (2) Fortune is ·

a sovereign protected by firmness. (3) Firmness is government Ι
