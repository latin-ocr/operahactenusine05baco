.separately and in secret on matters of such great importance and
difficulty. For doing so is more conducive to secrecy, more
prudent for counsel, and more befitting to ensure safety; and it
saves us from being suspected of the treachery of another. If the
secret is revealed to one only he will take care not to divulge it.
It is not necessary to act thus in all matters, but only in rare
circumstances. It is always best sor a king to call his ministers
together and to consult with them publicly in all matters great or
small, as we have stated before.

As some ancient philosophers have said, a king of sound
Ι judgement is assisted and strengthened by the counsels of his
ministers‚ as a river is augmented by the help ..of its tributary
streams, although the river may be independent of their help.¹
By prudence and counsel is obtained what cannot {be obtained by p. ¹35)
power and an army.

And it is written in one of the.books of the Persian& A king
advised his son saying :² Always takecounsel, for thou art but
a single man. And consult with him who reports to thee con-
cerning the infidels‚ and takes advantageof an opportunityagainst
thy enemy, andprevents thy enemy from taking ⁴(advantage of an
opportunity against thee.³

And let not thy appreciation ⁴ of thy own judgement or thy high
station prevent thee from adding tothy counsel the counsel of others.
For if their counsel is better than thine own‚,thou mayest accept it,
and isit is weaker than thine own, thou canst do without it.5

O Alexander, the best and most emphatic of my advice to ,thee
is this, that thou never be content with only one minister. For,
doing so will ruin thy subjects, and thy stateand thy army3 ‚it will
and the king could rely on his advice and be better inclined to peace, and
pay less attention to their advice on account os the mutual jealousy ot

colleagues. For there is greater safety in revealing the secret only to one
at a time, and the king is more sure. But when the opinion osone of them
seems sound, and <discord> appears among them, the king can rely on it
without consulting any one else W.

¹ And Bhtrn the Greek said: The elever king gains by the advice of his
counsellors just as the sea gains by the ssow of the rivers W.

² And one of the kings of Persia said unto his son W

³ sor among men there will be found some one who can explain hidden
secrets W.

⁴ Wadds: nor the liberality.

⁵ Isthy opinion will agree with their-s, then thine will get stronger by it.
f Isit be different, then take heed and consider it caresully and ponder over
it; if it is more profitable accept it, and isit be less then leave it utterly.
