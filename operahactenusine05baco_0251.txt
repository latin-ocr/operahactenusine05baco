On account of their great mutual friendship many moral letters
passed between them. One of them is Aristotle's reply to
Alexander. The latter, after conquering Persia and subjugating
the powerful ones of that country, had written to Aristode,

you that Ι have found in the land of Persia men possessing
sound judgement and powerful understanding‚ who are ambitious
of bearing rule. Hence I have decided to put them all to death.

and are able to do so by reason of your power over them,
you cannot change their climate and their country. Therefore
conquer them by kindness and benevolence, and so obtain their
love,—farewell.'

Alexander carried out these injunctions and made the Persians
his most loyal subjects.

of deep learning and unerring judgement‚ towards whom Ι used
courtesy‚ humility, and strategy, till at last he let me see the
writings deposited in that temple, and Ι found in those writings
what Ι was seeking for. Then Ι returned with my prize to the

I translated it from the Greek into Syriac and then from Syriae
into Arabic. The first thing that Ι had sound therein was a manu-
script of the philosopher Aristotle addressed to the Emperor
Alexander, as follows 2—-
