It is written in an ancient book that. a certain king called ’

together the physicians of an, India, and Persia, and ordered
them to name some medicine whose habitual us'e would be
beneficial and curative for all sorts of complaints. What the
Rumi chose and advised was the drinking of draughts of hot
water every morning. The Persian sage advised ‘Al-Harfa',
that is, cress. And the Indian advised Indian Myrobalan.¹
And Ι say to thee, O Alexander, whoever finds himself at night
without a weight of food on the stomach need not sear apoplexy
and pain in the j0ints. And whoever eats every morning seven
mithkals of sweet currants, need not sear any of the phlegmatic
diseases, his memory will be strengthened and his intelleet

free from bad smell, he shall be safe from intermittent sever, and
winds in the side.

And whosoever eats two walnuts with three seeds or grains of
figs and some leaves of the herb rue, he shall be safe for that day

fat chickens‚ and eggs. Heavy food is useful for people of hot
temperaments and those who have to perform hard labour before
and after sood. Moderate sood does not create obstructions or
dangerous superfluous humours or chyme. Such foods are:

fine wheaten bread, kids, sheep one year old, and in short, all ;
meats that are hot and moist. But they differ from each other ,
