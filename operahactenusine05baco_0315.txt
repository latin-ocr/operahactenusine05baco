after him calling out: “Stol), stop, Ι am dying 1' The Jew called
out in reply: ‘ Did Ι not inform thee of my creed, and didst thou
not inform me of thine. As thou hast acted according to thy
saith, Ι must act according to mine.’ Thus saying he went away,
leaving the Mage crying out: ‘Alas‚ do not leave me alone in
this desert, for wild beasts will eat me or I shall die of hunger and
thirst. Have pity on me as I had on thee.’ But the Jew paid
no heed to him, and, galloping the mule, soon vanished from sight.

The Mage, despairing of the Jew, remembered the concluding
part of his doctrine and saith that he had spoken to the Jew:
‘There is a just God in heaven, from Whom nothing is hidden of
the affairs of His creatures.⁷ Therefore he raised up his head to
heaven and said: ‘O Lord, Thou knowest that Ι have saith in my
religion, and Ι act according to it, and I praise Thee as Thou hast
heard. Therefore, O Lord, prove those attributes of Thine to
the Jew.' Thus saying he went on. Having gone a little way he p. 146
found that the mule had thrown down the Jew and broken his
neck and a leg. The Jew was lying on one side and the mule
was standing on the other. The mule seeing his master came
near him. The Mage mounted on it and went away, leaving the
Jew in t'he agonies of death. The Jew cried out: ‘O Mage,
I deserve now thy pity even more, as I am lying on the ground
and arn at the point of death. Therefore have compassion on
me and carry out the injunctions of thy creed, even as thy creed
has helped thee in punishing me. Verily Ι had committed no
sin, as I had only acted upon my creed and that which had been
taught to me by my parents and teachers.’

The Mage was moved with pity, and lifting him up on the
mule brought him to the city and made him over to his relations.
The Jew died after a few days. The king of that country hearing
the account of the Jew and the Mage, made the latter his com-
panion and friend. The Mage on account of his wisdom and
sincerity of saith was soon made his Wazir and one of the chosen
grandees of his court.

Therefore see how God the-great rewarded the Mage for his
good saith and sincerity, and how He punished the Jew on
account of his evil-mindedness and wickedness. Verily God
compensates every one according to his saith and action, either in
. this world or in the next, and verily He does what He wills.¹
