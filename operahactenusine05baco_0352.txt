SUMMARY OF INTRODUCTORy
TREATISE

(p. 1) This short and useful tract explains some obscure sayings
in the Secretum Secretorum which Aristotle wrote in his old age for
Alexander the Great; it was made by brother Roger Bacon, of the

order of Minors, of his charity for the instruction of certain wise men. .
A wise man who studies and discusses it thoroughly, together with the μ

notes which brother Roget· has in many places added to the text, will
discover the deepest secrets of nature to which man or human invention
can attain, and thus be called in truth first of the world. Nor need
any one despair, since if he knows the natures of things, perspecfive,
and astronomy, those secrets cannot remain hidden from him. (F ollow

chapter headings.) (p. 2) It is to be thought that the translator of this Δ

book (called the Secret of Secrets of Aristotle or the book of the *¹

Governance of Princes, Kings, and Lords) might have rendered many
words more accurately such as Mancia and Geomzmcz'a and Celimancz'a
and Incantacz'o and Carmen, which are neither good translations nor
consonant with religion. The fault is due to the ignorance of transla—
tors. ‘ Mancia’ means divination‚ as practised by magicians and
mathematicians (using the word as if derived from ‘ matesis ²—magic
which negatives sree will). True mathematicians (from ‘ mathesi '‚
teaching) judge differently. (p. 3) Mathematics includes four sciences‚
Geometry‚ Arithmetic, Music, and Astrology, which contains Astrology,
judiciary and operative Astronomy. Cassiodorus is quoted. He then
quotes Evrardus with a reprimand for his ignorance of Greek quantities,
and finishes the chapter by explaining the belief os false mathematicians
in the power of the stars over free will. ·

Chapter 2, of true mathematicians‚ explains their position. They do
not presume necessity in anything open to the will, and do not attempt
to foretell all event5,‘nor any with certainty, (p. 4) as this child will be
a good man or a bishop, if God wills. They forsee possibilities‚ know-
ing sufficient causes, but always assuming free will. Their-art consists
in knowing the position of the planets in the signs of the zodiac, and
their relation to each other and the fixed stars, and so they can judge
of the influence they may have on mundane things. But God may

alter the event, and even the merits of a good Christian; a poor old,

woman by her prayers and merits may alter the course of nature, as
blessed Scolastica when St. Benedict was about to depart from her
