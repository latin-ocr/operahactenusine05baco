On the policy regarding the officers of lzt‘s army and the soldt'ers. Section I

O ALEXANDER, armies are the essence of state and the glory
of the empire. And thy sovereignty depends upon the method
thou employest in arranging thine army, which should be such
that thou shouldst remain acquainted with the affairs of all of
them whether far or near, and it should be easy for thee to know pr 150
their number, and to call² any number thou wantest without
delay or confusion. The least number of the chief officers should
be four. Verily Ι have said ‘four’ because there are four3 points
of the earth: back, front‚ right, and left, and so are there four
cardinal points: north, south, east, and west. Therefore appoint
an officer to each point. But if thou wantest more, let there be
ten. Because ten is the perfection of four, since in the number
four there is one, two, three, four, which when added gives ten,
so that it is the perfect number, which is eomprehended by
four.

And let each one of the officers (Amirs) have under him ten
sub-Officers (nakibs), each of whom, in his turn, should have
under him ten other Officers (ka'ids), and each ka’id ten 'arifs, and
each ‘aris ten privates. All of these make a hundred thousand
warriors. So when thou wishest to guard one direction with ten
thousand men order all the sub-Officers (nakibs) with ten ka’ids
each, i. e. 1003 and draft with each iza’id ten ‘arifs, i. e. 1,000;
and drast with each ‘aris ten privates, i. e. 10,000. And when
thou wishest one hundred men order only a single ka'id, and let
there be drafted with him ten ‘arifs‚ each having ten men under
him, which amounts to one hundred. And if thou wantest only
ten men thou hastto order a single ‘arifi and let there be drafted
with him ten men.

Thus thy labour will be lessened and time saved for other p, 151
affairs. As every one has to look after ten men only, there is less

excellent order in the degrees of knights, so that nothing that is nigh or sar
