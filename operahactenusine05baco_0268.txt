moderatiori in filling his stomach or in leaving it empty, or in
sleeping or wakefulness, or in motion or rest, or in purgatiori, or
letting blood, or in excessive cohabitation‚ is not safe from the
onrush of diseases and sudden illnesses which I shall describe ι
later. Now Ι am going to mention some advantages of moderation
and evils of indulgence and excess. ·

It is agreed that whoso guards against excess, and observes
moderatiori and temperance, obtains health and long life. Ι do
not find any one ,οἱ the ancients disagreeing in this, that all the
affairs of this world-power, wealth‚ pleasure‚ and sensual gratifi-
cation-—depend upon existence. Therefore whoso loves existence

p. 66 ought to observe all that is useful and agreeable to it, and shun
sensual things, not preferring one meai to many meals. μ

Verily Ι have heard it related of the famous Socrates· that he
used to impose great abstemiousness upon himself. A disciple
of his said to him : ‘ O sage, if thou wilt increase a little thy sood,
it will increase thy strength and vivacity.' He replied: ‘ O my
son, verily Ι eat in order to live, and do not live in order to eat.'
And I have seen that those who are abstemious and temperate,
who restrict themselves to vegetable food and practise physical
exercise‚ are healthier in body, keener in appetite, and lighter in
motion than these who indulge themselves. Evidence of this is
found in the ease of people subject to labour and fatigue, Bedawin,
and ascetics. And it is a true maxim that the best medicine is
moderatiori in all things.

O Alexander, know that the preservation of health is obtained,
by the will of God, by two means: firstly, eating and drinking
that which agrees with the individual, the time of the year, the 4
individual’s habits, and the customary nourishment by which his
body is sustained. Secondly‚ purging himself of the superfluity
which is engendered by destructive and corrupting humours. As

p. 67 the human body and whatever is taken into it of food or drink
are gradually dissolved and sostened by natural heat‚ which dries
up all the moisture of animal bodies, as well as of the rivers and
seas: therefore, if the body is soft and warm, hard food benefits
it most, because the solvent power of that body is great, by reason
of the openness of its pores and the strength of its heat3 but if ¹
the body is hard and turbid and dry, then food that is moist and ξ
mild is the most beneficial, because the solvent power of that ,
body is weak, by reason of the narrowness of its pores. In order
