wine, appearing as sections l and p. It would be of course just
possible that Philip had before him a composite manuscript, but
unless this manuscript also contained the translation of Johannes we
can hardly account for the fact that Philip’s translation is verbally
the same excepting the interpolations necessary to make it represent
the Eastern text.

The first paragraph (p. 68’7‘27) is taken over from Hispalensis!
with the addition of some half-dozen words. In the second he adds
about fourscore, some explanatory, as in p. 69⁸, where the morning
wash is restricted to hands and face, mouth, teeth‚ and head3 some-
times destroying the sense, as when he adds ‘in hyeme autem
calida ’, the omission of which restores sense to the paragraph. It
. will be seen that paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 on p. 73, all of p. 74 after
line 4, and the first two paragraphs on p. 75 are not in the Western
version.

We are undoubtedly in the presence of a tract of Greek origin,
and it is a curious coincidence, since one of the later sections (m) is
derived from a treatise of the pseud· -Diocles, that its subject· matter
is identical with that of the treatise of Diocles on diet, preserved by
Oribasius, and that it is not impossible that its main features are
derived from it. As Fredrich says in his Hq‘ppokratzkclze Unter-
suchngen, there is very little difference in any treatises on health
from the seventh century before Christ to the eleventh after.

Note that the remedy of King David (p. 73¹⁰) so much struck
the imagination of Bacon that he recommends it ii‘i his book on
Old Age. ¹ ’

The chapters on the seasons are particularly good examples of
Philip's procedure. 'lake that on Spring (p. 76). Up to‘ anni⁷ is
in the Eastern text, from there to ‘eorundem’ is Philip's amplifica-
tion. The next sentence is taken over and amplified from the
Western version. The lyric description of spring, only found in
the Eastern text, is faithfully rendered until he reaches the statement
. that the life of the Bedawin becomes pleasant, for which he sub-
stitutes ‘ cantant aves, resonant philomene '.

The inclusion of these Chapters on the seasons in a treatise on
diet follows classica] precedent, but the treatise as it stands in the
Eastern version is clearly written in a country which has four regular
seasons, and a temperate climate, perhaps in a hill country some
considerable distance from the Mediterranean where classic writers
recognized six seasons (Varro eight).
