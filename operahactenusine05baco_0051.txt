text is of this class. Much of it, but not all, is derived from Razis,
otherwise no Arabio original is known.

What is curious is that while Philip's text nearly certainly had the
‘ de ventre ¹, yet Mesue, while really quoting from Razis or some one
of his school, attributes his quotations to Aristotle instructing
Alexander, and actually gets near a quotation from p. 69¹.

Section n, de conservantibus sanitatem, is of unknown origin, though
lines 1 and 2 of p. 88 are found in Razis. It is difficult to under-
stand the fact that nearly every good manuscript of the Secretum
omits lines 22 and 23, ‘Indus dixit . . .’, though they are in the
Arabic text. It may be conjectured that they had been accidentally
omitted in the reviser’s text.

Who was the man of royal and imperial family (p. 882⁵> who used
figs and rue as an antidote? Was «it, by chance, Henry III's brother
Richard, Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans (1250), or Charles of
Anjou P

Section o, de cibis. This section derives from some as yet un-
identified source: its author is of the school of Razis. There is
nothing like it in Serapion, Isaac, Haly, or Mesue. It quotes (90¹⁴)
from a ‘liber vde pulmentis et medicinis' not yet identified. The
precepts' as to drinking water are, generally, similar to those of Greek
physicians. The chapter on wine is evidently not Mohammedan,
and is much enlarged by Philip.

Section p, de corroborantzbns et macerantibus. As Bacon remarks,
this sectionis a repetition of section n, this time from t-he Eastern
version.

Section q, de balneo. This seems to be the first account in
European lang-nages of the Hammam or Turkish Bath as we know it.
Avicenna (I. i. 2—19) describes only three chambers of the bath, the
first eooling and moistening‚ the second warming and moistening‚
the third warming and drying. This arrangement resembles that of
the Roman baths‚ and his system is evidently founded on the current
treatises of Galen and Hippocrates.

Section r (pp. 98—104)‚ de medicim's. In this section we have a
receipt for a panacea. The various prescriptions are noticeable for
the comparatively small number of ingredients they contain‚ when
compared with any of the better known formularies, or those pre-
served in Budge's Syriae Book of Medicine. It is curious that
