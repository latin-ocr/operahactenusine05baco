spheres, the human soul is stirred up and becomes joyful and
strong.1

And one of those things which thou must know, O Alexander,
ls this, that the soul' acquires the power of finding out inner
truths‚ by external signs, when it happens to be-free from lust and
pain. This power is known by thought. And when the soul
predominates over the body and nothing intervenes between the
spiritual substance which lies in the heart ‘and the soul, and
the animal part which lies in the brain‚ the intellect is freed from
impurities and the object is reflected in it. Hence divination,
which is mentioned in many books, and of the truth of which
many wonderful instances are recorded.v {Bm this also depends
upon the conjunction of stars happening at the time of the ,
creation of this power. Ι ’

Therefore the Science of Physiognomy is as much necessary
for thee as those other sciences which rest upon conjecture. Itis
a great science, and the ancients knew it and practised it, and
prided themselves upon possessing it. It is a true science‚ and

longing' the discourse. One of those ancients who excelled in .

this art and who professed its truthsulness is Aklimsm. He used

¹ C reads: Ο thou who art afflicted with mental diseases, thou must ·

remedy thern. And their remedy is carried out only by musical instruments

'which act through the sense of hearing. The harmonious sounds are

caused by the striking together os the heavenly spheres and their circular
mnotionS. And the harmonious tunes of nature act upon the⁴ sources of

health. Since the working os human nature accords with, andimitates, the ·

working of universal nature, it is fitting sor man to turn to his own nature
and temperament. And when there occurs concord and mutual agreement
between the two natures, human nature is aroused aud its lise substance
comes into action and imreases, and it expands and there ssows into it the ·
substance which stirs it to cheersulness.

And it was sor this reason that the Persianas, when they desired to give
theirjudgements. used to order that music should be played, and songs and
poems sung- bearing upon the question under their discussion. For by this
means they believed that their judgements would yield to them and would
conform to the right in their creed.

And this is, by thy lise, on'e of their right experiences. And if it was not
sor the sear os prolonging this discourse and explaining at length what thou
canst understand by the least sign, 1 would have elucidated this point
further. And 1 have also mentioned it in the book which 1 have composed
on music and various kinds of sciences. Verilyjt is one os the sour sciences ¹
which are the pillars of the world. But we shall not discuss it here
at length.
