have been in his hands. Ι must confess that the arguments of
Prof. Foerster on this point do not carry conviction to me. On the
other hand there is no reason why Scot may not have had the Arabic
text, or its sources, before him.¹ ’ ⁴

There can be no doubt but that Philip was acquainted with the
work of his predecessor at least, and that he incorporated it in his
text. The paragraph ‘Cum hoc corpus corruptibile sit ² (p. 68) is not
found in the Eastern text, but is the introduction to the 12th ‘gate’
of the Western text, and could only have been taken by Philip from
Hispalensis direct. From this point to p. 81¹5 Philip incorporates
the Hispalensis text, adding his own translation of the large additions
in the Eastern text. He then found a long section in Hispalensis
(81¹⁹-83¹⁵) which was not in the Eastern text at that place—and this
he took over into his book without noticing that it came in later
in his text (885-8910 being the same as 81¹⁹-³⁰‚ and 94²²—962 another
form of 821-838). Lines 9-15 on p. 83 are probably an addition to
some MS. of Hispalensis and are not in either text, though incorpo-
rated by Philip (lines 16—20 seem to be a gloss, added sometimes at
the end of the ‘de oculis’, p. 86). We may note that one or two

a verbal agreement with the secretum.

In part i. chapter 1, in a long discourse on conception :

p. 212 Et sicut de calibe et silice exit quandoque scintilla, ita de spermate
exit quandoque conceptio, et matrix est embriom' sicut olla ad coquendum epulum
(cf. 166⁶).

Part ii, chApter 24, aster quoting Hippocrates, Galen, and Rhasis:

p. 264. Sed antequam veniamus ad totam intentionem nostri sermonis ex
praerogativa dicimus quod valde cavendum est in ornni tempore ab obviatione et
societate hominis infortunati. opus naturae superioris, ut ab homine cui diminutum
s1t aliquod membrum. ut oculus, manus, etc. (cf. 1673).

Cap. 65, in the course of a chapter of over sixty lines:

p. 299. Cujus nasus fuerit simus significat hominem impetuosum, vanum
mendacem, luxuriosum, debilem, instabilem, cito alteri credentem et con-
vertibilem ad utrumque. Cujus nasus fuerit in medio latus et declinet ad summi-
tatem sui, significat hominem facile mendacem, vanum, luxuriosum, verbosum,
ἃ, crudelis fortunae (cf. 16825, 16823).

These extracts, of which only the first three show verbal coincidenceS, do not
seem sufficient to warrant the assumption of anything ruore than a knowledge
by >Scot os the treatise on Physiognomy in either Arabic or Latin. The history

ὀί this section of the work is still so obscure that it is quite possible that it
was translated as a separate work and incorporated by Philip in the same way
as the translation of Johannes Hispalensis.
