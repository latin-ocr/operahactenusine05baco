Therefore‚ O Alexander, consider this speech and act according
to it, and follow the example of God in all thy actions.² Let there
be five ministers to thee, and consult them all separately in all thy
affairs. It will be better for thee. And do not reveal ‘to them
thine own counsel and intention, and do not let any of them. know
whose counsel thou dost prefer, and do not let thern think that

all that they have to say. And if they are hasty in their replies
and are of one opinion, then contradict them, and show them the

dost carry it out, because secrecy is essential for success in all
affairs. Experience and practice will show thee which one os them

the parts os the body, and from without and within it moves and regulares
reason. lf anything should happen to the soul, then body and reason are
destroyed3 but if anything happens to the reason and the soul remains
perfect, then the body remains hale until troni the Lord comes the destruction
of the whole, when the destined term os lise is accomplished (in succession
to p. 230, l. 21). Ι
