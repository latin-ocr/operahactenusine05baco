der Araber im zelznlen Jalzrlzemdert n. Chr. The Mage carne from
Kerman and the Jew from Ispahan. The conversations are fuller
in the earlier form, which has not the introducti0n and the final
paragraph as to the reward of the Mage. The story is not found in
some Arabic MSS. of the Secretum, while it is replaced in the
Western version by some general remarks,

Section F (pp. 146—7)‚ de scribis. Discourse V. In the seven-
book scheme of the Western Arabic text this section is not counted
as a separate discourse, but is comprised in Discourse IV. 'lhe
emphasis on fine handwriffing, which is minimized in Philip's version,
is characteristic of its Persian origin. It will be observed that
lines 9 and 10 are a perversiori of the original, which warns the king
to keep a close watch on his secretary.

Section G (pp. 147-8), cle nunciis. Discourse VI. This section
is in the Western version misplaced after section H, and is there
reckoned Discourse VII in the eight-book scheme or V in the
seven-book scheme. Philip seems to have misunderstood his
original in lines 24 and 25. Line 25 is indeed unintelligible in any
text: it should say that affairs may not go as you foresaw‚ as the right
course to take might turn out to be different from that you had
ordered. The last four lines of the section have been given a different
bearing in the Latin: the original says nothing of the punishment of
a faithless ambassador, as to: which no advice was needed in the
East.

Section H (pp. 148—9), de subditis. Discourse VIL' Philip mis-
translates l. 25 and the three which follow it. The text contrasts
trees which do not require to be sown every year with annual plants.
The last sentence is an addition of Philip.

This section is the concluding part of Discourse IV in the
Western Arabic seven-book form, and is Discourse VI in the eight-
book form and its Hebrew translation, though it is really included
in Discourse IV of the preliminary list of books (p. 179).

Section Ι (pp. 149-51), de proceribus. Discourse VIII. This is
also Gate VIII of the Western text, though it is part of Discourse VI
in the preliminary list of books.

The method described in this chapter of organizing an army by
tens is that of the Roman army with its decurions, centurions‚ &c.,
which passed over to the Byzantine Empire. It was adopted by
γ’ Gengis Khan as described by Abul Faraj, Chron. Dynast. x, p. 450,
ed. Pocoek.
