An account of this method of calculation ls found in the thirteenth-
century Syriae Book of Medicine, published by Dr. Budge‚ vol ii,
pp 540- 1, whose translationis here quoted:

Another calculation whereby a man is able to know beforehand
which of two men who are striving together will die. It was made
by Aristotle for King Alexander his royal disciple, when he was waging
war against Darius the Mede, and Alexander conquered Darius.
This calculation is sure, and hath been well tried. It is useful to
everyv one who wageth war against his neighbour, and striveth in
respect of matters of business, and to kings, and to» all men, both
little and great. Observe when thou wishest to know when (two) men
are waging war against each other, which¹ will conquer. Take the
numerical values of the letters of the name of each by itself, a'ndvtake υ
srom the sum of each as many nines as there are in each, and see
how many remain to thee in each case, and bear> them <in thy mind).
Then come to the following letters, and from them thou wilt learn
which will conquer. One conquereth three, five, seven3and nine.
Two conquereth one, four, six, and eight. Three conquereth two,
five, seven, and nine. Four conquereth one, three, six, and eight.
Five conquereth two, four, seven, and nine. Six conquereth one,
three, five, and eight. Seven conquereth two, four, six, and nine.
Eight conquereth one, three, five, and seven. Nine conquereth two,
four, six, and eight. And: if there be two in one name, or the
numbers in the two ¹names are equal, the combatant, that is the
elder will conquer the younger. This calculation is a very sure one,
and it is mentioned by the philosophers. When they made the
calculation about Alexander's name there remained eight, and when
they made the calculation about the name of Darius there remained
seven 3 and observe that eight conquered seven, so it cometh in one
case after another, with the thing that was lost and‘ was found, and
with the man who died, and with the man who was healed, and so on
when thou knowest well the name of the sick man and the name of
the day in which he perceived his sickness.

Ibn Khaldun in his Prole'gomenes (nomes et Extratls, 19. 241)
has the following account:

Parmi ces systemes, on trouve une espece de calcul (hicab) auquel
on donne le nom de lzzcab en- πίνη. Il en est question vers la fin du
Kitab es· Siaca (T raite de politique)‚ ouvrage attribue a Aristote. On ·
emploie ce calcul quand deux roxs vont se faire la guerre, et que l’on
de'sire savoir lequel sera vainqueur. Voici comment se fait 1’ operation.
