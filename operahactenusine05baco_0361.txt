LE SECRE DE SECREZ

(Bibl. Nat. sr. 25407‚ ff. 173*19⁶·)

The writer of this version of the secret ofSecrets is variously known as Piere
d’Abernun, Piere de Vernon and Piere de Peckham. The second is the name
by which he, was formerly known, and under which he is treated ofin the
Histoire litte'raire de la France; but as ‘de Vernon ' is merely an arbitrary and
entirely unnecessary rendering os the ‘de Abernun’ in 1, 2379 os the text it is
now no longer used. ⁴

Abernon gor Abernun as it was written by the Normans) is the old form os
Abenon³ a commune of the canton os Orbec, in the arrondissement os Lisieux.
The land in the eleventh century belonged to an old Norman family, a branch
ofwhich followed the Conqueror to England and came into possession os estates
in Cambridgeshire and Surrey. We hear that Enguerand d'Abernon was
present at the founding of the Abbey of Savigny in 1112. Piere probably lived
towards the middle of the thirteenth century, according to M. Paul Meyer who
treats, in his article on the French MSS. in Cambridge (Romamn, xv, p. 288),
of the possible identity of Piere d'Abernun and Piere ,de Peckham. This
identity is accepted by M. Gaston Paris and other critics ; ‘st is based chiefly on
11. 2362-7 of this text, but the fact that the Abernon family is known to have
settled in England is os importance‚ and also the resemblance in language and
style of the two works, Le Secre' de Secrez by Piere d‘Abernun‚ and La Lttmere
as Lais by Piere de Peckham. There are several MSSJ of this latter poem in
England——two in Cambridge, and three in the British Museum—and it is said
to be of the thirteenth century.

Le Secre' de Secrez has been sometimes assigned to a rather earlier date3
Barbazon even fixed it so early as before the twelsth century, but the language,
as de la Rue pointed out, shows a later development of Anglo-Norman. The
manuscript is in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, in a volume os pieces of
the twelsth and thirteenth centuries.
