to vomit in this season, as the superfluous matter of the body
increases in summer and rises to the top of the stomach. Purga-
tives and gargling should be avoided except when quite necessary.

THE AUTUMN SEASON.

When the sun passes into the first degree of Libra it is the
beginning of autumn. It lasts for 88 days and 171²& hours,
beginning on the 24th of September (Ailul) to the 22nd of
December (Kanun 1).

At this time the nights and days become equal for the second p. 79
time, and thenceforth the night begins to grow longer than the
day. Summer is at an end and autumn has come. The air is
cool, north winds blow, the season changes, waters lessen, rivers
dry up, and springs subside, vegetation is dried up, fruits are
exhausted, men garner grain and fruit, and the earth loses its
beauty. The insects die out, reptiles retire into their holes‚
birds and wild beasts disappear in quest of a warmer climate.
Provisions are collected against winter. The weather changes,
and the earth becomes like a mature matron who has passed the
years of her youth.

This season is cold and dry, and suits such foods and drinks
as are ¹ warm, soft, and moist‚ as chickens, mutton‚² sweet grapes,
and well-matured wine. Such things as produce black bile³
should be avoided. Motion and cohabitation and gargling may p. 80
be indulged in in this season more freely than in summer, but
less than in winter and spring. The frequent use of the bath is
recommended.⁴ If one feels the necessity osvomiting one should
do so either in the middle of the day or at its end, as superfluous
matters of the body collect at these times.

As purgatives he should take Garikun (Agaricum) and Aftimum
⁴ (dodder of thyme) and anything that drives out choler and sostens
the humours, by the help of Almighty God.

THE WINTER SEASON.

When the sun enters the first degree of Capricorn it is the
beginning of winter. It lasts for 89 days and 14T12 hours, from
the 22nd of December (Kanun 1) to the 21st of March (Azar).
