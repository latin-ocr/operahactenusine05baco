course of his life. And God alone helps us to do things rightly, and no
one has power and strength except Him.

When reason is persected it assimilates and adds to itself good
morals and manners, as a healthy body assimilates and incorporates
with itself the food it takes. And morals in their turn nourish and
develop reason as food does the body. But when reason is imperfect
it rejects good morals and good manners, as a diseased body rejects
and fails to assimilate the sood it takes, however healthy and nourish-
ing it may be. And if a person of vitiated mind acquires knowledge
and is taught good morals, the knowledge turns into sophistry and
ignorance, and good morals or virtues into bad morals and vices, even

as the nourishing and healthy food taken by a person of diseased body ⁴

turns into poison.

Hence Ι admire the wise man whose sound reason proceeds from his
sound mind, his sound judgement from his sound knowledge, his know-
'ledge srom his logical mode of thought, whose argument is tempered
with politeness and pertinence‚ whose good actions proceed from his
good principles, whose good conduct is the result of his good intentioris,
whose liberality is the outcome of his generosity of disposition, whose
charity of true self·denial‚ and whose efforts are guided by moderation.
Again, that man is worthy of admiration who has acquired the
soundness of mind by means of his good character, keenness of intellect
through reasoning and investigation, correctness ofjudgement through
his experienoes, truthfulness through culture, culture through hard
exertions‚ liberal-mindedness through sympathy and discrimination,
perseverance and painstaking through his rigid piety.

But when desire and passions overcome reason, they make virtues
turn into vices: forbearance turns into grudging (or secret enmity)‚
knowledge into hypocrisy‚ wisdom into cunning, culture into boastful-
ness, eloquence into volubility, generosity into pride (and love of show),
economy into miserIiness, forgiveness into cowardice. A man in this

ι condition thinks that the only health is the health of the body, and the ⁹

only knowledge is that of over—reaching and preying upon others, that
the only wealth is money, the only firmness is amassing and preserving
riches, and that the only power is that of overawing and treading
down mankind. And all these qualities lead their possessor further
away from happiness and safety and plunge him into misery and
destruction.

But when reason preponderates and rules over desire and passions,
the very vices turn into virtues ε stupidity and dullness turn into gravity
and forbearance, impetuosity into ready wittedness, cunning into
wisdom, volubility into eloquence, inability to reply into dignified
taciturnity, brutality into civility‚ rashness into valour, timidity into
prudence, extravagance into liberality.
