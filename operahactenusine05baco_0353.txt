prayed for a storm to delay him. And this alteration in the course of
nature may take place in animate bodies. The human body is chang-
ing every hour with the action of the various constellations and disposed
to various actions though not forced. Osten the natural disposition

’ requires no forcing, (p. 5) but people do what their nature inclines them

to do. Just as a man does things in the company of his friends which
he would otherwise not have thought of doing, so the constellations
may strengthen his disposition, though they do not force him to do
anything. According to Avicenna‚ thought and working of the soul
produce various effects in the body like heat or cold. Kings and other

- rulers should take note of this action on the soul by the habit of the

body as affected by the stars. If a true mathematician knew the exact
birth-date of any prince he could judge of his nature and qualities.
For all men follow their complexions. And if a king is ofa choleric
complexion he will be naturally inclined to pride and anger, and war,

ι &c. And his councillors and kingdom will follow in his path, ancl

neighbouring kingdoms will also be disturbed. If he is of sanguine
complexion he will be humble and prudent and peaceful, &c And so
on for the other complexions. And all who rule are swayed by their
complexions unless God ordains otherwise. But if they have good
advice from learned physicians skilled in astronomy‚ their evil com-
plexions can be changed for better, and they be inclined to all good.

(p. 6) Chapter 3 is of the sayings and doings of false mathematicians
and demons. True and false mathematicians alike can do much good,
but the false think their results come of necessity. They also fall into
other errors, desiring the help of demons‚ making charms (carmina),
talismans (karacteres)‚ and sacrifices, such as are described in their
wicked books or revealed to them by demons. Such books are the
Book of Adam, the Book of Moses, the Books of Solonion, the Books
of Aristotle, and of Hermes, which are not by them but by evil men,
and by „them many are seduced. Ι have known very great people,
even educated princes, to study them. And demons appear to these
mathematicians in human form and otherwise, and say and do wonder-
ful things. Sometimes they appear in reflecfions, as on the polished
nails of virgin boys, and in basins and swords, and in the blade bone
of a ram, and other polished things, and show them all they ask.
And boys looking on these polished things see stolen goods, and to
where they have been taken, and by whom, and so on. But the
frenzy of these false mathematicians goes further, without the demons'
appearance, but to pure magic, (p. 7) and they do many things useful
to some and harmful to others, by the invisible aid of demons‚ God
permitting. Thus the geomancers make signs and figures in sand, and
believe they know all secrets‚ past, present, and future, and overseas

“ they sit in public places and are openly consulted, they pretending

that they work by consulting stars, so that many famous students
