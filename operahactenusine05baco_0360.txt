mental faculties is reason, the least of whose wealth is his knowledge,
who is decorated with art and ornamented with learning. Whose
abundance increases with his t-hanksgiving to God, and from whom
evils are averted by his praying to Him.

But, when a man is deprived of wisdom, no king can make him
exalted‚ and no treasures can make him rich. And whosoever is
without saith no teachings of the doctors and theologians can make
him a true believer.

A brave man resembles a lion, a cowardly bully a wolf, a cunning
person a fox‚ a fool a donkey. One who has neither exterior nor
interior beauty is like a weed, and he who possesses only personal beauty
but not mental and moral excellence is like the leopard; one with an
” ugly exterior, but inner excellence is like the almond. One who com—
bines in himself both the inner and the outer excellences is like the
melon of Damascus which is beautitul in colour and shape‚ fragrant of
smeIl, and sweet in taste.

No untruthful king deserves to be called a king, and no hypocritical
hermit merits the name osa hermit. No faithless brother is a brother.
No boastful giver deserves to be termed benevolent. A man of learn-
ing who does not benefit others with his knowledge is like a miser who
buries his treasureS.

It is unworthy of a wise man to grieve at the occurrence of missor-
tunes‚ for no one whose heart is occupied with sorrow can successfully
fight with evils.

He is not truly benevolent who shows kindness only to the good, but
he who is kind to all. He is really truthful who speaks the truth to
one who has been false to him, and honest is that man who keeps
faithful to one who has betrayed him. He is trulyjust who does justice
to one who has been unjust to him.

Likewise truly charitable is he who returns good for evil, forgives his
oppressor, and shows generosity to one who has been niggardly towards
him, who never sorgets a kindness shown to him‚and forgives and forgets .
the evil done to him. Truly brave is he who pardons his enemy when
the latter is at his mercy, and who befriends all those in need of help.

Verily a wise man never seels ashamed of the obscurity of his birth
nor grieves on account of poverty.

A wise man seeks the nearness of God instead of that of kings‚ and
sears Him instead of his enemies. He envies no one, and seeks pre-
cedence over none. He desires neither the robes os a doctor nor the
sceptre of a ruler‚ nor the pomp os a courtier. ”
