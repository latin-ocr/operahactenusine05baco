prudenee and resolve and obedience if thou wouldst be rightly
guided. If thou desirest this, make the ascendant the road, and

the seventh (house) the town and place thou journeyest to, and the
tenth (house) the object of thy journey, and the stake 'of the earth
its result. ἡ ’

Beware of starting on a journey when the moon is unlucky, or
under the rays, or in the sixth or twelfth. Also beware of Mercury
being under the rays of the sun or in retrograde. But when it is
auspiciously in the ascendant it is a sign of success. Especially if it
is Jupiter, and it is in the middle of the sky, it predicts the fulfil-
ment of the object and its completion. And if it is in the seventh
house, it foretells the success of the action, joy and happiness, and
attainment of the object. And if it is inv the stake of the earth, it .
prophesies a completion of the matter and a good result.' But
beware of the moon being in the act of coming out of the house
fourth to the sun. And if thou findest auspicious planets over-
looking the sun from the fourth house thou shall}⁹ soon return safe
ancl successful. ·

And if thou startest on war, let the lord of the ascendant be in
the house of Mars, in the middle of the sky, and let Mars be over-
looking it with a friendly aspect. Let Jupiter be in the fourth
house, and let the moon be good, for it is in all journeys the most
potent srgn.

thy royal company, concealing it from thee, and which I am now
disclosing to thee, according to our covenant. It is one of those
mysterious sciences which God has inspired me with and directed
me to, through His mercy and wisdom.‘·'
