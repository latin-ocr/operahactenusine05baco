- 1t was the astrologers who made the extension. If the moon
influenced the blood, then any position of the heavens which modi-
fied its powers, for better or worse, would necessarily affect that
influence.

Philip, or his copyist, was evidently not an astrologer, as is evident
by the mistake on line 16 ‘Mercurius' for Mars : an astrologer would
have used the symbol and avoided the possibility of error from the
use of a contractiori in writing. All the Arabio texts give 130 instead
of ‘4⁰ or 60 in line 11, and instead of Taurus, Cancer, Pisces, and
Gemini in line 12 give Sagittarius, Aquarius, Capricorn, and Gemini.

As to cupping, Philip's text directly contradicts the original as
regards the age of the Moon, which should be in its first fortnight‚
and again puts Mercury for Mars (l. 7): in line 8 ‘Mercurius'
should be Jupiter. Lines 9 and 10 are a complete mistranslation.

In the paragraph as to laxative medicines the text is abbreviated.

¹· The mistake as to Mercury is repeated (p. 119¹).

The final paragraph on p. 110 with the sphere on p. 111 is not
part of the original Secretzmz as we have it in any Arabic manuscript.
None of the Latin manuscripts known to me contain the sphere
except those which derive from the Bacon text. The table on p. 1 12
may be of Bacon's composition. Bacon's treatise on Astrology (Op.
My'. i. 376) may be compared.

Section u (pp. 217—18)‚ de musica. A short section, on the curative
power of music in mental diseases, is not translated in any Latin
version known. It is followed in the Arabic by the section on
Physiognomy. When the original tenth book (Eastern version) was
broken up, a part of it (sections O and P) was brought here to change
places with the Physiognomy.

Section O (pp. 1 14-17)‚ de alclzt'mz'a. We have no Arabic original
for the first paragraph of this section, which looks as if it had been
written by the editors of Philip when it was transferred to this place
and broken off srorn the first part of the book (pp. 157-63). The
‘de lapidibus ' referred to (l. 23) is printed by Rose in the Zeltsclcrisl
fiir deutsches Altertlzum‚ xviii. N.F. vi (1875), pp. 349 sqq. It has a
preface resembling that of the Secretum and purports to have been
translated from Greek into Syriae. The ‘ de plantis ' is probably the
well—known work of that name translated early in the thirteenth

century from the Arabic into Latin by Alfredus Anglicus de Sareshel,
⁶ and printed by Meyer in 1841.
From this point (p. 11425) on we have one of the earliest and
