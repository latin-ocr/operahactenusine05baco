absence of a Greek text could make no difference to its reception—
there was no original text known at. the time of many other un-
questioned works of Aristotle—though Bacon seems to have
hypnotized himself into a belief that he had seen one (p. 172¹0).

The Secretum is perhaps the best known of that large family of
works in which the man of the study takes upon himself the task of
telling the man ofaffairs what he should do. Whistler is reported to
have said that if artists went upon the Stock Exchange the qualities
necessary to make them good painters would enable them to beat the
men of business out of hand. No doubt the charlatan element in
his own character would have carried him far on the road to success,
though the state of his affairs does not lend support to his dictum.
The long list of late classical treatises given by Mai in his Scriptorum
vet. nova coll. ii is a proof of the popularity of the theme. There
are several Arabic treatises of the kind, the relation of which to the
Secrelum is not close. Among these are EM. Add. 7453 (the teach-
ing of Aristotle, see p. 284), and the ‘Peri Basileias' published in
Arabic and Latin by Lippert in 1891 as a Halle dissertation. Giraldus
Cambrensis wrote c. 1217 ‘de principis instructione ³, ed. Warner,
1891, Guibert of Tournai ‘eruditio regum et principum' (1259),
Ptolemy of Lucca (d. 1322) ‘de regimine principum ad regem
Chypri', printed under the name of St. Thomas, Aegidius Colonna
‘de regimine principum ', the author of the ‘liber de informatione
principum’(1297-1314) translated into French by Jean Gollin in
1379. William Peraud, prior of the Dominicans at Lyon, ⁴ de erudi-
tione principum ’‚ also printed among the works of St. Thomas, F ray
F rancisco Ximenes, Bishop of Elenia‚ ‘ Crestia, regiment de princeps '
(see Knust‚ p. 297). Other works are—John of Wales (d. 1303),
‘ Breviloquium ², and Vincent of Beauvais‚ ‘de regimine principum '
(c. 1263).

The ‘Somnium Pharaonis’ of Jean de Launha or de Limoges is
a very interesting work of this class, evidently written in consequence
of the popularity of the Secretum. It is dedicated to Thibaut of
Champagne, King of Navarre, and was once assigned to the early
, years of the thirteenth century. In that case it must be before 1216,
but modern scholars put the date as about 1250, a much more

robable one.
