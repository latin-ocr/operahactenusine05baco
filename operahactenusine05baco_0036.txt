XXX

His variants are often improvements on the reading h'e has adopted
in the text, and Ι would have been tempted to substitute them if
I had not been prevented by my plan, which is to give a faithful
account of the manuscript before me. In the present instance there
is tlfe less need for it, as any reader can satisfy himself at once which
reading is preferable by a reference to 'the translation of the Arabio
text.

His explanations show that he was at the time ‘of writing ignorant
of Arabic, two French words being represented as Arabio. They
seem in most cases to be pretty obvious, and show that he did not
expect much intelligence in the reader.

His digressions are more interesting. They reveal his pre-occupa-

tion with magic, with medicine, and with alcherny, and give us .›

little sidelights on the history of his time, like that on poison (p. 88)
or on the cure of a prince (p. 105). From a note (on p. 165) we
learn that the Aristotelian physiognomy had recently been translated.
