The following table is given by Fredrich, op. cit., p. 226:

Spm’ng. Summer. A utumn. Wtfnter.
93 92 = 185 91 89ss9o = 180
Pseud-Eudoxos 91 92 = 183 91 91s92 = 182
Demokritos 91 91 = 182 91 ’ 92 = 183.
Euktemon 90 90 = 180 92 93 = 185
Kalippos 92 89 = 181 90 94 = 184

The Western form seems to have been modified a·- little by its
passage through Africa somewhere about the eleventh or twelfth
century. Johannes Hispalensis added to his version, at the end, the
following paragraph, which was not in his text as far as we know:
‘ Quatuor equidem anni tempora per partes distinguntur, ut a medio

Marcii usque ad medium Junii ver habeatur, a cujus· medio usque¹

ad medium Septembris estas computatur, a medio Septembris usque
ad medium Decembris autumpnus, a medio Decembris usque ad
medium Marcii, ubi ver incipit, hyemps habeatur.' Some texts of
his version have been enlarged by additions from Philip's translation.

Section l, de calore naturali, is taken over (and expanded a little)
by Philip from Johannes Hispalensis. Comparing it with his trans-
lation from the Eastern text lines 19-30 (p.- 81) correspond
almost word for 'word with cap. 20 (pp. 88-9), pp. 821-838 with
pp- 94²²-902-

The ‘ regula Ypocratis ’ has not been traced. We may conjecture
that it was present in the copy of Hispalensis used by Philip, as it is
found in all the manuscripts.

The paragraph beginning ‘ Curacio enim . . .’ belongs to the next
section and is usually found at the end of the ‘ de oculis ’, the words
‘Habeatur semper venter laxus in omni egritudine ex replecione'
being added. γ

Section m, de divisione corporisss is only found in· the Eastern
version, and is therefore a late addition. It is a translation of part
of a tract by the pseud-Diocles, which is preserved for us at the end
of the second book of Paulus Aegineta. It was translated into
Latin half a dozen times in the sixteenth century, from apparently
two differing texts, but was known in England in Anglo-Saxon. The
treatise is nearly identical with that written for Maecenas by Antonius
Musa, published in 1538, and resembles -in some respects that of
Soranus. The four parts of the body are the head, chest, belly, and
genitals. Very early in the history of this translation of the Secretum
a chapter ‘ de oculis '. was substituted for that ‘ de ventre '. Bacon’s
