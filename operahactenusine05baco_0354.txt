have been misled. And other magic arts in which the devils delude
thern are hydromancy, aeromancy, and pyroman'cy. And people are
so misled, either because of their own infidelity, or that of the magicians‚
or for other sins, as rnay be seen by many things that happen in these
times, as when people are bewitched‚ ἃς. And from these talismans
and charms and figures and magical doings come the errors of old
·women, witches‚ διε. For the first were taught by magicians, and
parents teach their children, and the evil grows and will grow till
Antichrist comes. And many false teachers will precede Antichrist,
and teaching like the errors in philosophy begun fifteen years ago, or

the heretical doctrine taught, prepare people for Antichrist, who taught '

by demons will fulfil (p. 8) all their evil desires, and prevent all good
and true.

Chapter 4, of the sayings and doings of true mathematicians. These
hold themselves aloof from all evil and know how to select times in ‚
'which the stars can assist nature, by God’s disposition, to do great
things by nature and art, not using magic or old wives' charms, but the
grace given to philosophers. How far this grace extended we cannot
say, but would to God all Christians had as much. Philosophers like
Plato, Aristotle, and Avicenna were not idolaters, but worshipped God
like the Fathers from Adam to Moses. Aristotle had the cult of the
Trinity. Christian astronomers should pray to God and the saints,
and use figures of the cross, crucifix, Blessed Virgin, and St. Denys
(who was a great astronoiner), and other special saints, and observe
due seasons. Thus a physician should expose his medicines to the
sky when favourable stars are above the horizon, ancl guard them from
unfavourable ones. The same should be done with food and drink.
(p. 9) Sick and insane persons should be exposed to favourable
constellations. By this way the mental and moral status can be
improved, as Artephius did. This course ought to be followed out
with kings and princes and prelates, not only for their own good, but
sor that of their subiects. And many other things might be done for
public utility in this way whichAristotle describes in this book, but
secretly. ·

Chapter 5, of the true sciences with like names to the four false oneS.
Geomancy is magic, like some kinds of aeromancy, and hydmmancy,
and pyromancy. Other sciences of the same name are parts os
experimental science. According to Ptolemy, the science of prognosti-
cation is duplex, one by Astronorny which gives a judgement midway
between necessity and impossibility. Another, which considers future
alterations, Ptolemy calls Experimental Science, (p. 10) which was
much enlarged by Aratus. This science observes signs in the earth,
the air, and fire, i. e. the sphere of fire by which philosophers foretell ,
all future changes. The poets speak of this—Virgil, Servius his com-
mentator, Lucan, and others. Avicenna tells how a hedgeh‘og showed
