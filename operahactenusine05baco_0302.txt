in it everything of the sciences of philosophy,1 and the quality
and the composition of reason, and I have revealed in it certain
divine secrets as they were indispensable for thy instruction in
the reality of reason and the manner of its distribution among
the creatures of God, and the method of gaining knowledge

thereos. Because verily it is of utmost importance‘to thee.
'iheresore comprehend it, if God will.

Know, O Alexander, that the first thing created by God,
glorified be His name, was a simple spiritual essence in exceeding
perfectior] and excellence, in which were the forms of all things.
This He named Reason. Out of this essence there was created
another, next to it in rank, which was called the Universal Soul.

Out of the latter He brought into being a third essence named
Matter (hyle, hayfila). Matter on receiving dimensions, i. e. length,
breadth, and thickness, became pure body.

Then this body adopted a spherical form, which is the best
of all forms, and greatest in ‘space and continuation. Out of this
spherical form then were created the heavens, planets, and' all
other etherea] bodies, the purest of thern beirlg the first and the ⁷
coarsest the last.

So, beginning from the first, or the all-comprehending sphere,
to the last sphere which is the sphere of the moon, there are in all
nine spheres one within the other. The first and the highest is.
as mentioned before, the all-comprehending sphere. Next to it
is the starry sphere. Next to it is the sphere of Saturn, then the
sphere of Jupiter, then of Mars, then of the Sun, then of Venus,
then of Mercury, then the sphere os the Moon, and then the
sphere of the elements: fire, air, water, and the earth. So the
earth is the centre of all the spheres, and it is the coarsest of'
all bodies in essence and‘thickest or most solid of them in
substance. ,

And when these spheres were arranged in one another as the
wisdom of the Creator had decreed, in the wisest and the best
arrangement, and revolved with their substance and their stars
around the four elements mentioned before, and night and day,
summer and winter, heat and cold followed one another, and
when all these were mixed and tempered with one another, the,
siner mixing with the coarser, the heavier with the lighter‚ the
warni with the cold, the moist with the dry, there were formed?
