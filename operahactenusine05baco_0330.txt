motions of the seven planets and of the head and tail of the
dragon. And that thou shouldst know al] about their conjunc-
ti0n‚ moving forward, aspect of one another from the third house,
fourth house, and the sixth house, their ascendancies, and
descendancies, their limits and directions, and. how they happen
to agree and disagree among themselves. How they‘ receive
light or reject it. v β

Thou must particularly know how to find out the correct

nativity with or without an astrolabe. And thou shouldst know

f. 60 A the stakes and the stars on their right and left. How long it takes
a planet to pass through a sign, its middle and the direction of its
rays. Thou must know all this with* extreme correctness and
observation. Thou shalt be mostly concerned with the hours of ,
the rising of auspicious planets, their length and breadth, rising
and setting.

And when thou hast known all this, together with what has
been taught to thee before about the knowledge of minerals and

p. 161 vegetables‚ their connexions with the planets‚ and the knowledge
of the relationship of each part of the body of the physical
objects‚ mineral, vegetable or animal, with the planets, thou shalt
know that everybody is ascribed to one planet generally and to
several planets partially. Man, for instance, is ascribed to the
Sun,1 but in detail his head also is related to the Sun. Similarly
minerals are related to Saturn, and specifically lead is also related
to the same planet. Likewise every organism and every member
of it. Ι

T herefore when thou desirest to bind those spiritual, living and
potent powers to these compound bodies, and thou knowest
already the connexions of the latter with the planets in general
and detail, thou shouldst find out its nativity‚ and the nativity
required for thy purpose, the governing spirit of that nativity.

Let Saturn be confronting it or looking at it with the aspect of
friendship. And let the direction of its rays be towards the
country thou art in. And never commit an error in thy operation.

p. 162 Let the moon be adjacent to the head and tail of the dragon and
auspicious to thy work.

Then fix the heavenly form of nativity to its relative body.
Then thou shalt see from its action and powers what will astonish
and please thee, if God wishes.
