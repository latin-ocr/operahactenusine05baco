The astronomical statements—only found in the Eastern text—‘-
are very interesting. Their definiteness seems to point to an
authoritative source on which they are based, but I have been quite
unable to find any translated astronomer who gives such numbers.
The length of the year as Bacon amends the text- is 365 days, but
substituting the true reading on p. 80¹¹-89 days 14 hours—the
length comes out as 365 days 6 hours 11 minutes <the true length
is 365 d. 5 h. 48m. 46s.)‚ Hipparchus giving it as 365 d. 6h.; the
number adopted by Bacon himself in the Communia Naturalium
(p. 420).

The date for the vernal equinox—the beginning of the solar year-—
is March 22 (put in accordance with the Bononian computation as
‘decima die exeunte Marcio'). In the Arabic the names of the
months are given in their Syriae form, as is usual in astronomica'l
works, since the lunar Arabic months are unsuitable for calculationS.
Thc date of the equinox was adopted as March 21 by the Council
of Nicaea in 325, by 1079 it had shifted to March 14, and in
Bacon’s time to March 13. Bacon gives “³⁶32 date of the equinox
at the Christian era as March 25 (Op. Δία). i. 271l‚ which is that
given by Hippocrates (‘de hominis structura ad Perdicam')‚ and
pseud-Diocles. Haly takes the equinox as March 17. A glauce
at the table below will show that the date in our text of March 22
for the equinox is not consistent with the other calculations given:
it is probably a concession to the Christianity of the author of the
treatise from which it was taken.
