a change os weather; dolphins‚ rustling of the trees, and swelling of
waters also foretell it. Meteors aud other appearances in the air, the
rainbow and haloes show changes in the air. Comets also have a great
significance, like that of 1264, which caused much disturbance in that
and the following years, and frightened all men. These comets fo'llow
the motion os some planet or fixed star, (p. 11) like iron the magnet‚
and they are generated in the sphere of fire, as Algazel teaches. There
are many signs of greater significance than these, such as the sight of
two or three suns or two or three moons at once. We can read of such
in Livy, or Orosius, or Augustine, and of the changes which followed.
Also there have been showers of milk and blood and many other things,
and springs of oil or blood have risen out of the earth, which have
preceded great changes. Eclipses also are to be considered in this
connexion. Astronomers consider the position of the sun and moon in
the signs, but experimental science considers the way in which the bene-
fit of light is cut off from the world. There is a very great change,
especially in a total eclipse, the effectos which is described. One will
come sooner than astronomers predict. These effects are called by
Ptolemy ‘secondaries of the stars ⁵, and he says that a more accurate
judgement can be formed by them than by the stars themselves. Aristotle
and others, he said, depended more on it than on astronomy. (p. 12)
Considering then the etymology of these words geomancy‚ ἃς. It is

obvious that sound sciences, considering only natural objects, can be '

found of geomancy, aeromancy‚ hydromancy, and pyromancy. It was
these sciences that Aristotle wrote of, not the magical oneS, but the
translator had no other terms to use in Latin.

ι Chapter6gives some instruction in astronomy which is necessary for
the understanding of the last chapter of the second part and the last
two of the third part. The universe is spherical as regards its con·-
vexity, except the earth. The earth is naturally spherical, because it
lies in the centre of the universe, and in the concavity of the sphere of

, water naturally, as it was in the beginning and will be in the end. The

waters were withdrawn to make it habitable so that, (p. 13) according
to Esdras‚ six parts of the earth are land and one water, agreeing with
Aristotle. The succeeding spheres are air, fire, the Moon‚ Mercury,
Venus, Sun‚ Mars, Jupiter, Saturn‚ Fixed stars‚ Watery or ninth
heaven, Empyreum or tenth heaven. (p. 14) There are ten heavens,
and four spheres of elements ε seven heavens of the planets, the eighth
of fixed stars‚ because they are always at the same distance from each
other. Each elemental sphere revolves less than that above it, the

, earth not at all, water little, air more, fire, moved by the sphere os the

Moon‚ rnost. To understand the motion of the heavens we have to
imagine a number of circles. The first are the equinoctials. These
γ’ circles are in the eighth and ninth heaven. Another in the eighth
and ninth heaven, north and south, is called ‘zodiac’ from the figures
