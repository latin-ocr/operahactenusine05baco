it, and he who seeks (and labours) deserves success, either by his
reaching his object or his object coming to him.

How many secrets and mysteries‚ partial and universal, there
are in this world ! People pass by them turning their faces away
from them, without seeing them or understanding them! It ·is
because their minds are bent on something else and their objects
are different. Now I am going to inform thee of those things
which thou canst perceive in this world with thy senses. They
areos two classes, matter and form. Form continually exists
without increase or diminution. But matter does not exist at all
times. You see only the forms of animals, vegetables‚ and minerals
externally existent. They never grow more or less. It is only
matter of which they are composed in various combinations of
the elements1 that is not constant ; while matter may be massed
together or diffused, form remains permanent and changeless.

And the cause of the permanence of forms is the reflection of
their types from the planets as mentioned before.² But this
reflection too undergoes continual changes according to the Ρ· 160
motions of its planet. And their continuance depends upon their
increasing action on matter. And the modons, powers, and
actions ‘of those forms are according to the temperaments of
their planets.3 And the property that prevails most on the actions
of the forms shall also prevail most on the temperaments of their
bodies, as God has willed it.

Therefore it is necessary for thee, according to what I have said
and explained, that thou shouldst know the motions of the celestial
sphere, and its signs and planets [and the fixed and retrograde
stars and the signs of Sagittarius, Pisces, Gemini, and Virgo (B)].
And that thou shouldst know the various spiritual bodies working
on the signs and the planets. And that thou shouldst know the

trary parts, which are continually composing and decomposing.

² B reads (aster ‘from the planets as mentioned besore’): For the planets
are continually undergoing changes of conditions and never stay in one con-
dition. Therefore it is evident what Ι have told thee, that celestial forms
are reflected in the lights os the planets which are intermediaries between
them and the elementS.

‘And thence those forms are reflected on the elements which receive
their impressions according to their capabilities (and their continuance
· depends, δια).
