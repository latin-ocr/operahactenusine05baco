On tlze Kinds, of Kings.

Section] There are four kinds of kings: 1. A king who ·is liberal t
himself and liberal to his people. 2. A king who is liberal
to himself but miserly to his people. 3. A king who is miserly to
himself and miserly to his people. ’

The Rumi say that there is no barm if a king is miserly to*

P· 43 himself but liberal to his people. And the Indians say that}
it is right for a king to be miserly to himself as well as to his
people. The Persians contradict the Indians and say that a king}
ought to be liberal to himself as well as to his people. But all of
them agree to this, that to be liberal to himself and miserly to his
people is vicious for 3 king and corrupts his kingdom.

In this discourse it is necessary for us to explain liberality and*
avarice, and to describe the evils of excess in liberality and those·
of deficiency in it.

It has been already explained that all qualities and actions are
vitiated as they approach their extremes, and that it is extremely
hard to observe moderatiori ιη liberality, but that it is easy enough*
in the case of avarice. Moderation in liberality is to give what is
needed and when lt is needed, and to help a deserving person to the',
extent of one ’s ability. But if one exceeds this one becomes guilty
of excess and falls into extravagance. And he who gives what·
is not needed is unworthy of praise. And he who gives untimely
is like one who gives water³ to one who is himself standing ons
the bank of a river. And he who gives that which is⁴ not needed,
