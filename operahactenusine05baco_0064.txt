days are nearly always considered unlucky ; they occur in the Coptic
year as September 5—10‚ in the Sothic year July 15-20, and in the
Alexandrian August 24-28. ·

The five ports of the sea must be Bacon's addition3 they are
found in no other text, Arabic or Latin, that I have met. They are
obviously the Cinque Ports.

The whole of this digression leads up to the advice to Alexander
to have five chamberlains and five counsellors. But the Western
text, on the contrary, advises only one counsellor, whose advice is to
be taken on every occasion. The two texts come together again on
the advice of Hermes (p. 13 5²⁶) and immediately diverge—the
Western text* still presupposing a single counsellor—until p. 136¹⁷
when they again meet. In the tale which follows the astrological
details are only to be found in the Eastern version. Mars is now
substituted for Mercury (see p. 108) as a favourite planet. ‘ Venere ’
(l. 3) should be ‘Virgine ' and ‘ Libra' should be ‘Jove '. Bacon's
conjecture is all wrong according to his own table on pp. 21, 22.

From p. 13733 to p. 138¹² is only found in the Eastern version,like
the passage from p. 139²⁴ to p. 140⁸. In 140⁶ the Arabic reads ⁴ the
days of joy are seven, so are those of sorrow ’, instead of ‘the days of
taking medicine are seven and the critical days of a disease are
seven ’. From p.140²¹ to p. 141¹² also is peculiar to the Eastern text.

The qualities of a good counsellor, pp. 141-2, differ slightly
in each manuscript.

Section D (p. 143), de microcosmo. There are many variants on
this theme, and no two lists are precisely the same. It is entirely
Eastern in character, no hint of it being found in the various writers
on the microcosm and the macrocosm.

A somewhat similar idea is found in Cardonne, M‘e'langes, ii. 83 z
‘ N ouchirsvan, king of Persia, asked his Wazir, Buzur Djumher, for a
definition of courage. He said: A brave man should have the
courage of a lion, the valour of a cock‚ the impetuosity of a boar, the
ferocity of a wolf, the rage of va tiger‚ the cleverness of a fox, the
patience of a dog, the vigilance of a mane, and the prudence of
a raven.’ ³

A number of such comparisons are found in the Eastern animal
stories.

Section E (pp. 144-6), de sllago et Judeo. This story is found,
in the tenth-century encyclopedia, the lklzwan as-safa, published
by Dieterici in 1868 under the title of Die Logik und Psyclzologie
