O Alexander, be careful of thine affairs, so that thine actions
may be right. It is good policy to remove the fear of thy punish-
ment from the hearts of pious and peaceful people and to inspire
the minds of suspicions characters and mischievous people with
the sear of thy chastisement‚ so much so that they imagine in
their seclusion that thine eyes are upon their actions.

O Alexander, garner up as much store of corn as possible as
a precaution against years of famine. And when there is scarcity
take out all that thou hast garnered and other people of thy
empire have garnered. This will put down every corruption and
disturbanee, and will help to give permanency to law.¹

Ο Alexander, the most emphatic command I give thee and
have always given, by obeying which thy rule will be strong and
thy sovereignty lasting, is to refrain from shedding blood without
cause and from exacting the extreme penalty of the law, for God

killed for the sake of worldly good, or on false suspicion, God
replies to His angels : ‘ By My glory and power 1⁶ I make forfeit ⁷
the blood of this Myslave.5 And the angels continue8 to curse
the slayer in all their prayers and invocations ⁹ so that his life may

¹ W inserts here : O Alexander, be strong in thy policy and sound in thy
judgement, and seek integrity, so that the people may follow thee. Be
gentle and compassionate, but let not thy gentleness and eompassion become
a mischief [when dealing] with such as deserve punishment and correction.
Ifthou look well to it, pious and righteous men will be safe from thy punish-
ment, while the sinful and corrupt will learn to know thy vengeance. The
Hebrew follows the Eastern text generally.
