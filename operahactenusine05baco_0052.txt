referred to in the Arabic text has yet to be identified. The ‘de
aquis' in line 13 is, as the Arabic text shows, ‘de urinis '. The ‘ de
medicinis compositis ’ has already been referred to (p. 90¹⁴).

The names of the eight physicians who invented this wonderful
medicine present some difficulty in the way of identification.- Here
are some lists.

(ι) Esculapius‚ (2) Hermogenes medicus, (3) Hirfos‚ (4) Dona·
sties, (5) Vatildos, (6) Hebrei, (7) Dioris, (8) Caraus.

(1) Ascalanus, (2) Nasiurus, (3) Ailin, (4) Dunntanas‚ (5) Kutarus.

(1 )Aflanus, (2) Nasy oras, (3) Hermes the second, (4) Bartomali,
(5) Dadastius, (6) Ablae, (7) Robaris, (8) F ataria

(1) Estefan‚ (2) Djasious, (3) Ankilaus, (4) Marinous, (5) Theodose'

(6) Afladious, (7) Johannes. Ι
Compare these lists with the names of the eight great physicians

in the Κιίαό al Fc'lzrist (p. 286).

(1) Askolapius the first, (2) Ghurus, (3) Minus, (4) Barmamdos,
(5) Plato the doctor, (6) Askolapius the second, (7) Hippocrates the
second, who took hold on souls„ (8) Jalenus, the meaning of which is
‘ the silent ².

Section s, de viperis. This section has not yet been found in any
Arabic text of the Secretum, and is in only a few Latin ones. In
nearly all of these it follows section t. The greater part of it, all
that is ordinarily found, is taken directly from Avicenna (1037), who
probably took it from Razis (d. 932), Ad Almansorem, t. 8, c. 2.
Bacon added the first paragraph and some further extracts. similar
passages are found in Serapion, tr. vii (f. 63⁹, ed. 1525): see also
Haly ii. 2. 52 and Galen, de antidota, pp. 19 3-6 (ed. 1560).

Section t (pp. 108—10)‚ de regimine medicine per astronomiam.
This chapter, which occurs only in the Eastern version, is interesting
as an early document in the extension of astrology to medicine which
became general in Europe at the end of t'he thirteenth century, and
is there attributed by Dr. Rashdall to the influence of the University
of Bologna—Cecco d'Ascoli summing it up thus¹z ‘Medicus sine
Astrologia est quasi oculus qui non est in potentia ad operationem)

There is no trace of this infiuence in the great classics o‘f Arabic
medicine. In some of thern the old belief that the quantity of
humours increased and decreased with the waxing and waning of the

moon, which was held by Galen and his school, appears in connexion .

with sanitary blood—letting, but nothing more.
