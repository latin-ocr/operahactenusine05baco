Minerals are all those materials which are formed inside the
earth, at the bottom of seas, and in the hollows of mountains,
- from the pent-up vapours, and rising smokes‚ and the moisture
closed in caves, and the atmosphere. The preponderating element
in all minerals is the earth. The minerals are: gold, silver‚ iron,
tin, zinc‚ and others which are known and exist. As for animatis,

These faculties work in the formation of the body of man, when
the seed is deposited in-v the womb it takes nine months to be
