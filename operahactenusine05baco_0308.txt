that counsel is the essence of true guidance.⁴ And it is written
in the books of the Persians that one os their kings took the
counsel of his ministers regarding a most important secret affair of
his state, on which his power depended. One of the ministers
said to him : ⁵ It is necessary for the king to consult with us
