deserves to be trusted most for his counsels and correctness of
judgement. Because a minister's counsel and his care in the
management of thy services shall be according to his love of thy-
selsand his desire for the continuance of thy sovereignty.

And beware of giving preference to one of them over another in
gifts, precedence, and other matters, For verily many states have
been ruined in ancient times owing to the rivalry of ministers and
their being given preference one to another. And do not show
more favour to a younger man than to an older one, except when
the counsel of the younger one happens to be superior.¹

And I say to thee, O Alexander, that counsel depends on the
body 3 and when the body grows decrepit through age counsel also
becomes weak.

Also correctness of judgement depends upon nativity. Every
one is born at a certain hour, ansd his Subsequent proficiency in arts
and his successes or failures in his undertakings depend upon the
influence of the stars ruling over his nativity. Even if his parents

Therefore they augured that the new-born child would be learned,
dexterous‚ and of sound judgement‚ and that he would manage the
affairs of kings. They wondered at it, but did not inform his father.
The boy grew up, and his father desired to teach him his own craft,
but the boy's nature was averse from it, and he refused to learn it.
His father tried compulsion and beat him until he was tired3 but
it was of no avail, so he left him alone. Then the boy turned
towards men of learning, studied sciences and bistones, and

hasten to fulfil it, but tarry sor a day and a night. 'But is it is a thing which
thou art afraid that thou couldst otherwise not carry through, then do it
speedily. And if aster proof and examination it will have become clear to
thee concerning thy counsellor, and os the love which he bears to thee, then

from a young man could be more profitable.
