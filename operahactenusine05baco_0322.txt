And let there be plenty of frightening and terrific sound-producing
instruments,¹ for verily they will inspire thy men with courage and
those of thy enemy with fear. Andlet thy army be clad in different
kinds of armour—some of them in mail shuts, others =in cuirasses,
and some in horse-armour. And when thou sendest out a detach-
ment to meet the enemy, send with them the artistic images,
wooden battlements with archers inside thern, and incendiary
machines. They will help to inspire thy men with confidence and
hy enemies with sear, and they will pelt thy enernies with arrows
and fire.

Draw up thy army in the order we have described before, and
put thy swordmen and wrestlers on the right hand, and the spear-
men on the left, and thy javelin throwers‚ archers, throwers of fire, ’
producers of frightening noises, and makers of various· motions in
the centre. And let this force occupy a raised ground overlooking
the enemy. Thus they shall have to look up at thee, and watch
thee, and, knowing that thou art watching all their movements,
they shall fear thee. ζ

Thou shouldst watch thy enemy attentively‚ and when thou
seest disorder in any part of the enemy’s forces direct thy attaek
on that part. And use firmness‚² which is a great help. Verily
very few armies have been defeated in ancient times except by

p. 154 losing heart and giving way to fear. Employ numbers of men to
lie in ambush ³ and produce frightening noises. It is a means of
giving an exaggerated opinion of the number of thy forces and of
inspiring thy men with joy and courage.

Thou shouldst make use of covered pitfalls and slippery ditches
in the path of the enemy whenever they are found necessary, for
wars are carried on by stratagem‚ and keep away thy own men from
them.⁴ And keep with thee many beasts of burden⁵ of Khurasan,
for they frighten the horses, and they will form a refuge in the
time of need.

¹ instruments which cause dread and trembling, which Ι made for thee
when thou didst engage in battle against Nahalah (Blhh. H.) the Indian.
When they heard those {rightsul noises their hearts quaked, the horses ran
away, and thy victory was due to this. It is needsul that thou d'ost control
the army so that thou knowest what is good for them and what is bad, for
when they perceive it they will be careful and sear thee W.

² act with deliberation W. ³ with fire W.

⁴ Make thee those terrible instruments called Almhavi in some countries ’
where thou wagest war, and protect thy cavalry from them W

'⁸ pack horses and elephants W.
