version. Discourses IV and V of the Eastern version make Dis-
course IV ‘of the Western scheme ; they contain long interpolations.
Discourses VI and VII are cut out of Discourse V, VIII is VI, and
IX is VII. Discourse IV of the Eastern scheme is further enlarged
by the story of the Jew and the Mage (pp.³‘144—6) which is not found
in the Western Arabic, and is replaced in the Hebrew version by a
warning against red—headed counsellors. Discourse IX is enlarged
by a section ‘ de electione temporum ' (pp. 155—6) of an astrological
character, while Discourse X, ‘ de scienciis incantamentorum' (pp.
157—63)‚ is a scientific theory of talismans, to which every Arabic
MS. adds a different series of illustrations. It includes the oldest
known text of the ‘Emerald Table ’ of Hermes. It is replaced
in the W estern form by Gate XIII which treats of alchemy, talismans,
and the properties of gems.

THE DATE OF THE EASTERN ARAfflc ΤΕΧΤ.

There can be little doubt that the process of accretion by which
this version was formed was a gradual one. One ofathe additions
(p. 58) may have been made at the beginning of the thirteenth
century. The passage ‘Sane puella in domo patrisfamilias ex nimio
studio sciebat cursum anni et astrorum, . . .’ may possibly be a refer-
ence to the learned lady ‘nondum vicesimum agens annum' Con-
stantina, daughter of the Archbishop of Athens, who ‘pestilentias,
tonitrua, eclipsim, et quod mirabilius fuit, motum praedicens, omnes
suos auditores infallibiliter praemunivit ' (Matt. Paris, v. 286). Mat—
thew's authority for this is John of Basingstoke, who had been her
pupil and who first appears in Grosseteste's Register as Archdeacon
of Leicester in 1240 (there was an Archdeacon Robert in 12 36—7) 3
he died in 125 2. If we assume, as an outside limit, that John was
60 when he became Archdeacon, he would be born about 1180, and
as we know that he studied at Oxford‚ and ‘ Parisius diu studuisset et
legisset ’, he could not have got to Athens before 1210, and most
probably much later, since the Testament of the PatriarchS, which
he brought from Athens on a second visit, was translated in 1240-2.
This gives us then an approximate date for the completion of the
longer Arabic version, as after 1220. But very possibly the Arch-
deacon's story is mere romance, and the reference in the Arabic text
is a generality, founded on some such story as that os Hypatia.

. ¹ The Archbishops os Athens in the early thirteenth century were Michael
Akominatos‚ 1175-1206 (Greek), who certainly never had a daughter, Berard,
Nov. 27, 1206—23, and Conrad, 1223-2‚ of whom nothing is known.
