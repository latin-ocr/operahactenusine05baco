thy epistle in which thou has kindly spoken of thy regret at parting “
with me andqat my inability to accompany thee-3 and thou
desirest that Ι should draw out for thee a code which should
serve as a guide in all thy needs, and take.my place-'with- thee in -
all thine affairs. Thou knowest that my remaining behind thee
has not been because I no longer desire thy company, but that
it has been caused owing to my advanced age and infirmity.

As for the matter that thou hast asked for, it is so great that
even the bosoms of the living cannot bear it—to speak nothing of
lifeless paper. My obligations to thee make it incumbent on me to
carry out thy request as far as it is right to do so, but at the same
time Ι conjure thee not to compel meto reveal this secret more
than what I am depositing in this book. If thou study it earnestly, ‚
I trust there will be no veil of obscurity between it and thee,

Ι have been bound. And he who betrays its secret shall not
be safe from the evil consequences which shall soon overtake
him. And may God preserve thee and us by His mercy.

Now Ι mention to thee above all else that which Ι wish to ·

make thy intimate friend [i. e. a constant rule of life]: that
a king must have two helpers particularly for himself: one of
them is intellectual, namely‚ the strength and composure of his
own soul. For the soul is strengthened by the union and com-
posure of its faculties just as a king is strengthened by union of
his subjects, and vice versa. Similarly there should be a perfect
harmonyand co-operation between the potential and actual faculties
of a ruler. ”

This harmony and co-operation among the two kinds of faculties,
or between the ruler and the ruled, are gained by two means, one
of them is evident and apparent, and the other is secret and-
