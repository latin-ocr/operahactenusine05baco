To which I would add

(f) Indus (p. 87).
(g) Physiognomy before Justice in list of books.

(a) The Pliny note is an early annotation often incorporated into
the text. (b) The chapter on Vipers belongs to a special tradition
of Paris and English MSS. (c) These are parts of the ‘dictio
decima ' on Magic, and MSS. showing (c²) are especially valuable as
showing the primitive text. (d) Many of the medicines were
omitted in the fourteenth century as unintelligible. (e) The ‘de
oculis’ is a very early corruption, and a MS. showing in its place
‘de ventre’ is valuable as derived from the primitive text. (f)
Most MSS. omit the Indian physician’s advice. (g) shows a con-
nexion with the uncorrected form of Philip⁷s text.

None of these eiiteria, it will be seen, refer to a divergence of actual
text3 they may be all either additions to or subtractions from one
original, with the exception of the ‘ de oculis' which is asubstitution.

We may offer the following provisional classification·

(A) Two texts preserve the original place of the Ph) siognomy, i. e.
before Justice: B N. 6756 <a fourteenth· ·century Avignon hand)
and Β Μ. 5 F. xiv (a sixteenth- -century composite MS. otherwise
important). t

(B) The following MSS. retain, in their list of chapter headings
only, the original position of Physiognomy: Β.Ν. 6584, 11118,
15081 (all thirteenth century), and 3358 (fourteenth century).=

(C) The following two classes of MSS. have the whole section on
Magic printed in this edition: BN. 6755 (thirteenth century),
6755 A (fourteenth century), 1 1 120 (fifteenth century).

(D) These MSS. placepp. 157-63 after p. 123⁶ before Justice:
evidently a mistaken attempt to reunite the ‘ dictio decima '. Β.Μ. Sl.
1934 (thirteenth century), 12 C. vi (fourteenth century), 12 D. iii,
Sl. 2413 (fifteenth century).

(E) The large class of MSS which omit the fourth to ninth
medicine, the greater part of the theory of magio, and the‘ de
viperis’ . Examples are Β.Ν. 6584 (thirteenth century), 6978, 11 1 19
(fourteenth century), EM. Eg. 2676 (thirteenth century)‚. Sl. 3469,
9 B. ii, S'l. 3554 (fourteenth century).

(F) In the course of the fifteenth centurya very much abbreviated
text came into circulation containing a certain amount of the medical
and didactic portions of the work. The abbreviation is so badly ¹
done as to leave the text at times unintelligible. The MSS-are
