of man, in whose composition all things are found. The universal
soul has three powers, intellective, sensitive, and vegetative, working
in bodies like sunlight in the air. This threefold division is that of
Bacon himself, since the Latin Vulgate and the Arabio speak of
a twofold division—the perceptive and the active, ‘ una quarum
virium est signum, secunda vero operans’ (13019), which latter has
seven modes of action. In line 22 Bacon alters ‘vegetativa' into
‘generativa ’, but the seven months assigned for gestation seems to be
due-to Philip, as the Arabic gives theusual number. The divisions
of human life (p. 13) vary from text to text. All agree on the end of
the first period, but the Latin Vulgate assigns 13, Bacon 14, and the
Arabic 15, as the next. The phrase ‘quia in 15m0 anno potest
generare ' is only found in Bacon's edition. All agree as to 30 for
the next period, but Bacon then jumps to 50, while Philip and the
Arabic say 40. The next period ends at 50 (Arabio), 60 (Philip), or
70 (Bacon), from which time the soul is preparing itself for the end
of life. If the soul is perfect and complete before its separation from
the body it is taken up by the ‘virtute anime universalis⁷ (Bacon
leaves out the mention of the ‘ anima ') to supernal perfection, until
at last it reaches the sphere of the intelligences and becomes part of
the Universal Soul. Philip, however, omits this last phrase, and
in its place substitutes one describing the fate of that soul which does
seek after perfection.

Section C (pp. 132-43), de bajulis. Book IV, Latin text. We
now return (p. 132⁹) to the original form sor four lines (l. 12 ending
‘regem in ipsa ’), and then begin a new digression on the senses,
prompted by the idea of reason as ruler of the body.

The paragraph as to the sense of sight is altered by Bacon from
ten to twenty-two species of sensation as in Alhazen whom he quotes
as the ‘ Perspective '.

In the description of the sense of touch Bacon adds (l. 26) ‘ et in
omnibus predictis de visu preter lucem et colorem ', and to that
of smell the whole of the paragraph as to human odour.

The final paragraph of the digression deals with the virtues of the
number five : five planets, five kinds of animals, five essential parts
of plants, five musical tones, five best days in the year, and five 'ports
of the sea.

These two groups are difficult to explain. The Arabic text speaks

νὀἵ the days as the last days ofAdhar (March), not May. I have been
unable to find any other trace of this belief. The five intercalary
