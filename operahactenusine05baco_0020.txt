in the Bodleian Catalogue‚ ii. 578, quotes Haji Khalfa ,10202 as Δ
concluding ‘Arabice vero in gratiam Almamun'ab Hanifa versum
esse '. Dr. Cowley of the Bodleian Library is kind enough to inform
rne that Pusey quotes from the Bodleian MS. CCCC.XXII which
has a different reading from Fluegel's text, and a better one. Hanifa
is, however, impossible as an epithet, and Dr. Cowley suggests a
simple emendation which makes the note read z ‘then the Caliph Al-
Ma’mun had it translated into Arabic, and thought very highly of it?
This disposes of Hanifa‚ and probably Y emeni should disappear with

of the Eastern form contains the treatise ‘ de conservatione sanitatis ²
(pp. 64-8), the summary of Johannes Hispalensis (pp. 68-83)‚ the
‘ regimen sanitatis ³, a tract of pseudo-Diocles ‘de divisione corporis’
(pp. 83-7)-—(the continuation of ¹the ‘de conservatione sanitatis’
(pp. 87—9) is only found in the Latin)—chapters on sood, water,
wine, and oxymel (pp. 89—94), a further continuation of the ‘de
conservatione' (pp. 94-6)‚ an account of the Hammam (pp. 96—7),
an account of the preparation of a universal medicine (pp. 98-105)‚
and an account of the use of astrology in phlebotomy and medicine
