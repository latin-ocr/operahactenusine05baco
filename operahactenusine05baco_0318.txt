depend on trustworthiness and faithfulness. ¹And if these are
wanting he will betray thee on the receipt of presents and bribes 3
he will commit perfidy in the duties thou hast entrusted to him ς
and thine administration will suffer in proportion to his treachery.

Section H THoU hast known, O Alexander, that the subject is thy treasury‚

which is safe from extinction and certain of perpetuity, and by
which thy government is established. T herefore consider thy
people as a garden in which there are many trees, and do not
consider it as a harvest which is to be gained only once in a year‘
and has to be re-sown in the next year. [Because trees of standing
roots have not to be sown every year, except in rare cases. There-
fore thine own position depends upon the state of thy exchequer‚
for it is the support of thy state and sovereignty (B. C.).]

And, as the subject is, thy treasure and the means of the exis-
tence of thy state, it is necessary for thee to cherish them, to
consult their interests, and to prevent them from such things as
are harmful to themss And do not appoint any overseer of their
lives and properties except one who is well acquainted with their
affairs, who is independent‚ trustworthy‚ honest, and faithful: who
would pick for thee their fruits without destroying the trees: who
is clement, patient, and forbearing, because if he is not so, he
will repe] men and corrupt pure minds. .

And do not employ too many superintendents to administer
thy revenues, lest it may produce corruption. Because each one
will wish to prevail against his fellow by corruption, and seek to
benefit at the expense of the people and collect taxes for his own
aggrandisement‚ and favour such as -help him in his position and
assist him in his falsehood‚ ⁸and God knoweth best.

¹ For the messenger without these qualities will betray thee by taking
money and gifts and will deceive thee in the object of his mission; you will
suffer loss in your affairs according to this treachery, therefore'keep in mind
this point and you shall be Sase‚ isit please God W.
