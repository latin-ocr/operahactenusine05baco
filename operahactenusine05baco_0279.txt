according to the manner of their cooking. Roasted meat de-
rives strength, beat, and dryness from the fire, unless it is treated
with something which will break up its heat, as vinegar, lemon,
tamarind‚ and cherrieS.

Similarly fried meats must be treated with spices. Therefore
follow this analogy and oppose hot with cold and vice versa
(i. e. in seasoning food), except in the case when you desire hot
food to counteract a cold temperament or to excite carnal
appetite.1 .

Some flesh soon changes into black bile, as the flesh of the cow, p. 90
the camel, the mountain goat, the Kata (sand grouse)‚ and the fat
goat, because they are heavy (or coarse) and dry by nature. But
the flesh of young castrated animals which feed on moist green
pasture and frequent the shade is the most tender and beneficial.

The same may be said about fish. Those which have a
small body and thin skin, which feed sparingly and live in sweet
and flowing waters‚ are lighter and better than those which
live in the salt sea and in lakes. Large fish with large body and
much fat ought to be avoided, as poison is to be expected
therefrom. And I have prepared a book on the subject of diet
and medicine for the use of the great and the common alike.
It may be consulted for further information.

Water is necessary for every living being and vegetable. And
I have already informed thee that all waters, sweet and bitter,
from sea or lakes differ according to district and the [nature]
of the earth and the rising of the sun and moon, and Ihave
explained the cause thereos more than once. The best and the
lightest water is that which is distant from buildings and is
obtained frorn springs. When the land is flat and bare and
contains little putridity‚ its water is good and light 3 but the
water found in wooded and tainted country is heavy and in-
jurious. One should avoid water in which is green slime or
worms. The best water is that which is light, co'lourless, pure,
and of good odom, which soon becomes hot or cold, and which
pleases nature, and that which flows from the west to the east.
