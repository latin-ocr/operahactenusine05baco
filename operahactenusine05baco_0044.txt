‘Guidoni civitatis Tripolis ‘, ‘Guidoni de Valencia vere civitatis
Tripolis ’, &c. Bacon adds the information that his see was Naples.
If the Archbishop really was a member of the Vere family, our
search is restricted to England and Northern France, and as Guy
de Vere is known to have been a benefactor to the order of St. John
of Jerusalem a sort of shadowy connexion may be said to exist.
The constant manuscript tradition which connects Philip with
Tripoli, and the reference to Antioch, may be explained by the
identification already suggested (p. xix). It seems a pity that
nothing is known of a prelate who, allowing for the enthusiasm
of a dedicator, must still have been a man· of unusual parts.

The chapter headings on pp. 28-3 5 are much enlarged by Bacon
from those usually found, and the division of subjects in the first
paragraph on p. 28 is entirely his own.

The prologue of the Arabic translator gathers up a number of
traditions of Aristotle, current in his day, which, as will be seen
from the notes, had become attached to other names. It would
almost seem as if the whole passage from 36¹³ to 38²⁶ was an inter-
polation, as it interrupts the thread of the translator's story how he
set about finding the secretum (p. 36⁸) and how he found the
‘desideratum opus' (p. 39¹⁶). In that case the interpolation must
be of ancient date, as it is found, substantially unaltered. in the
Western form. A certain number of Aristotle’s letters—genuine or
supposititious—are preserved in Greek, but these (p. 38) are not
among them. A reference to the Arabic will show how much Philip
misunderstood his text.

The story of the translator's visit to the temple of the Sun built
by Aesculapius (or Hermes) is a commonplace of Eastern prefaceS,
and has been the principal reason for assuming, not only that the
work itself is supposititious‚ but that-it had no connexion with
Yuhanna ibn al-Batrik.

The original Secretum—the Syriae text, if there ever was one-—
must have begun at p. 40. The notion of a secret doctrine and
an enigmatical mode of teaching is quite Greek. See, for example,
the letter of Plato to Dionysius in Macrobius, ‘Per enigmata de
talibus esse dicendum‚' or as quoted in Fernelius, l. 1, c. 10 dc
abditis rerum, ‘ Dicendum est igitur sed per aenygmata‚ &c.’

Section e, which follows in the Arabic, but not in the Latin*
translation, gives the list of discourses and their contents. It will
