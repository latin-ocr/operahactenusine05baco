the public generally. The distinction is one which dates from his
own lifetime3 it was universally known, and amply accounts for the
attribution of such a work as the Secretum Secretorum to Aristotle ;
no student in the Middle Ages could be blamed for receiving it as
possibly genuine, however different from the books he met with in
the schools. >

Had then the book any claim to a Greek origin? 1 think not.
Greek ideas, Greek commonplaces have been caught up into its.
text, Greek treatises have been incorporated with it, but the texture
itself of the original work is oriental, not western. Ι believe it to
have had its origin in the interaction between Persian and Syriae
ideas which took place in the seventh to ninth centuries of our era,
and probably at the same time as the Alexander legends studied ,by
Dr. Budge. ¹

It will perhaps be convenient to have a general summary of the
history of the text, before going into particulars. No Syriae text has
yet been found, though there is every probability that it has existed.
The Arabic is found in two forms which 1 name provisionally Eastern
and W estern. Both obviously contain additions, but fortunately
in the Western form the additions are nearly all at the end, while in
the Eastern they are incorporated in the body of the work. By
striking out these additions we get a fair idea of the text of the
work, which can be most readily studied in Dr. Gaster’s translation
of the H ebrew version of the Western form, paragraphs 1—79 omitting
48. Though the list of discourses in the Eastern form is 10 and the
Western 8 (or 7), the titles are the same and each is really in 10
discourses, though the Western calls some of them ‘gates '.

A Latin translation of a part of the Western expanded· text was
made early in the twelfth century, but the whole text of the Eastern
form was translated in the thirteen'th century by Philip of Tripoli.

No Latin text corresponds in order or content to any Arabic text
we know, and all the Latin texts we have are of the same general
form. The tenth discourse of the Arabic is cut up, a great part
omitted, the remainder displaced, part being added to the ninth, the
rest to the second book. A new tenth book for the Latin is formed
by taking the section on Physiognomy from the Arabic second book
and making it a complete book. It seems possible that the Vulgate
text thus formed is not the original Latin of Philip, but one edited

by authority. The reasons are (1) Philip speaks in his introduction ’

of geomancy. This (the calculation of the numerical values of
