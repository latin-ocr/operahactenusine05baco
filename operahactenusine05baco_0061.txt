Another form occurs in the Placita Philosophorum of John of
Procida. (r) ‘ Mundus iste est quidam ortus, et ejus fossata sunt
regna. (2) Regna vero manutenentur per leges. (3) Leges statuit
rex, (4) Rex vero per militiam suam tenetur. (5) Militia vero
pecunia gubernatur. (6) Pecunia autem a populo· colligitur.
(7) Populus vero estjustitia servus. (8) Justitia vero regitur mun-
dus.' Renzi, Colla-tio Salernitana, iii. 117.

It is noteworthy that the Placita Philosophorum is said to be
translated from the Greek by John of Procida at Salei-no, so that
there may be a Byzantine origin for this diagram. Α

The Arabic tradition is preserved by Al Makin in his Universal
History.

‘And Aristotle wrote in the book which hath been mentioned
adnionitions which would instruct a inan in the doing of justice, and
he said therein that justice is the strength of the world, that it is the
chief of all virtues, that wealth and armies increase through it, and
that nations become subject through it 3 he said, morevover, that
justice maketh a man to show himself friendly, and that it is the
strong prop of the world. Now he likened the world unto a garden,
the wall of which is kingship, and kingship is the knowledge which
maketh the king to administer wisely his dominions. The king is
the man who should help his army, and- the king who is helped by
his army shall gather together for it wealth and possessions3 riches
shall make a nation to gather together unto themselves benefits:
uprightness shall make slaves to submit unto a (free) people; and let
integrity be the working power in the beginning of thy words and in
the end thereos. Know too that· by it the whole world standeth, and
that by the excellence thereof cities are founded, and wealth is
gathered together, and that soldiers and armies increase thereby and
servea peopless Budge, Alexander, ii, p. 383.

Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406) 1n his Prolegomena (Notiaes et Εκῖπαιίς,
xix. 80) preserves another tradition.
