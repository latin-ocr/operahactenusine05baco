the Hermogenes of our text may have been obtained from one os
thern. The remainder of Discourse X consists of Sections O, De
alc-hirnia, and P, De lapidibus et vegetabilibus, which finishes with the
real ending of the secretum. Only a very few MSS. and no printed
texts go farther than p. 161²* (see pp. xxv—xxvi).

The title, found in this and some other MSS„ ‘ Dictio decima' is
interesting as a remnant of the primitive form of this translation,
before it suffered its first recast. It occurs in B.N. 6755, 6756,
B.M. Sl. 2413, 12 C. vi, 12 D. iii, 12 E. xv, &c.

Section V (pp. 16 3-7 2), de plzt‘sionomia. Prof. R. Foerster has dealt
at such length with this section in his Scriptores Plzysiognomom'si
(Teubner, 1893), vol. i, pp. clxxviii—clxxxi, vol. ii, pp. 183—222,
that little more remains to be said. It has already been pointed out
(p. xxi—xxxix) that the Western form is not an abridgement os the
Eastern, but an independent growth from a common stem. The
Eastern text has been much more influenced by the physiognomy of
Razis (ad Almansorem, tr. 2) than the Western. There are many
more verbal coincidences with Gerard of Cremona’s translation of
Razis than with Michael Scot's treatise already cited, e.g. 167²8 sa-
pientie innuit paucitatem (R. c. 26), 16814 deterior est omnibus
hominibus (omnibus hominibus sunt deteriores, R. c. 28), 16916 Qui
tempora inflata (R. c. 32), but I believe they are only coincidences
and that the borrowing took place in the Arabic.

The only quotations I have noted by Albertus Magnus are those of
p. 170, ll. 4—7, in the de animalibus, i. 2. 26 end, and others.

The story of Hippocrates and Philemon is originally told of
Socrates and Zopyrus—for classical references see F oerster, i, p. viii.

Section Q (pp. 17 3—5)‚ de lapidibus preciosis. This section, the re-
mainder of the thirteenth division in the Western eight-book form, was
incorporated by Achillini with passages from Discourse X, as pre-
viously described (p. xxiv). He either translated them himself, or got
them from an early Latin translation, from the Hebrew, as a con-
siderable part of them is not found in the Arabic but was added
by some Jewish alchemist, or by Al Harizi himself.

The sections only found in Hebrew are: (1) Sciendum tamen
quod scire producere . . . (2) Et facias anulum ex argento . . .
(3) Bis ipsum est ex venenis et magnis . . . (4) At sustentamentum
omnium . . . (5) Scias etiam quod chimia . . . Most probably
(6) Amatistes est piram in Arabico . . . is also an insertion, but
W is imperfect at this point (p. 253).
