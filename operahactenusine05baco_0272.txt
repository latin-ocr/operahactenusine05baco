wine mixed with about ten istars ¹ of water. ‚

p. 73 When he has finished eating he should walk a little on soft
carpets‚² then lie down on his left side andfinish his sleep.
Because the left side is cold and needs something to warm it.
And if one feels heaviness in his lower ribs, he should wrap up
his stomach with some heavy and warm eloth, or take in his arms

Because it is very injurious to the body to keep back the corrupt

And movement before food kindles up the fire of the stomach, Ι

p. 74 Sleep before food emaciates the body and dries up its moisture.
But sleep after food is nourishing and strengthening. Because
in sleep the outer part of the body becomes cool, and the natural
heat which is diffused throughout the body is collected in the
stomach and around it, and helps the stomach to digest the food.

mid-day meal has to eope with the heat of the day and the pre-
occupation of sense and soul with what the individual listens t0‚
or engages in, or thinks about, and with the fatigue and move-
ment around him. So that the natural beat is diffused over the
exterior of the body and the stomach is thereby hindered from

evening meal, for it is accompanied by rest of the body and
stillness of senses and soul and the coolness of evening, which
drives the natural heat into the interior of the body.
