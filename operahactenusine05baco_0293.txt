to tell the character of a man by the construction of his body.
⁶ There is a wonderful story connected with him which I shall
relate for thy consideration z

The disciples of the learned Hippocrates drew his picture on
a parchment and, showing it to Aklimun, asked him to describe
his character. He looked at the formation of the body and com-
pared the various parts of it. Then he said‘: ‘ This man must be
deceitful‚ cunning, and sensuous, and one who loves fornication.’
Thereupon the disciples of Hippocrates wanted to kill him, and
said ε ‘ O ignorant fool, this is the picture of the learned Hippo-
crates 1' He replie‘d : ‘You asked me to read his character from
this picture, and I did‚so according to my art.'

When they went back to Hippocrates they informed him of
what had happened. Hippocrates replied to them: ‘Aklimun is
right. By God! in all his reading he has not spoken a single
untruth. This is indeed my character, and such is my disposition.
But when I saw that these qualities were bad, I restrained myself

’ from following them, and my reason overcame my passions. And

the philosopher who cannot subjugate his desires to his reason is
no philosopher at all.’ And this added to the excellence of
Hippocrates for philosophy is merely mastering desires.

speculative and intellectuat sciences which it is necessary sor thee to know
- and to understand, because of the great need in which thou standest when
appointing men to stand before thee, I will therefore put down for thee in
this chapter all the tokens of physiognomy which are proved true and
known in the days gone by, and which we have tested in sooth from olden
times W.
