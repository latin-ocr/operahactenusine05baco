with the theory of its independent origin and subsequent adoption.
Pages 114-2 3, which are included in Book II of the Latin version,
rightly belong to the end of Discourse X-—the‘ dictio decima'.

Sections g and h I take to be mainly Greek in character, perhaps
modified by the compiler, as shown by the introduction of the
example of the kings of India, which is a commonplace of Eastern
authors. A number of Hermetic quotations-all hitherto unknown——
are included (pp. 522⁶, 5 5³¹, 57⁹). The last of these has been adopted
by Mohammedan theology‚ which tells of the katibun Kiramun—
the illustrious writers. They are mentioned in the Quran, Suras,
82. 50 a, ‘Yet truly these are guardians over you, illustrious recorders,
cognizant of your actions.’ The spirit on >the left is the recording
angel of evil according to the Mislzkdt, iv. 8. 1. Ι

The story of the poison maiden has been treated at length'by
Hertz in the Ablzandlungen d. k. bayr. Akad. le‘ss. Cl. I. xx. ‘Bd. 1. 91,
who has treated the subject exhausfflvely, and considers it of Persian
origin. The story is referred to by Razis, Contz'nens, xx. 2 (f. 4130,
ed. 1506), by Avicenna, Canon iv, Fen. 6, t. 1, c. 2, and by the

The sgtory of the Greek maiden (p. 58) has already been referred to.
P. 51¹³ is a Gnostic idea, see Hippolytus (tr. Macmahon), p. 145.

Section h, the only part of the original treatise devoted to astrology',
is Greek in character, and quite contrasted to the passages due to
later insertions. Philip was evidently a firm believer in the science,
for he has dealt with an argument against it founded on the divine
foreknowIedge, and asserts ‘cuncta sunt scibilia in via racionis ”.
The reference to Plato requires an elucidation -Ι am unable to give.
It is evidently some cry ptic saying of the Eastern schools.

Section 1, de conservanda santQtate is not included at the end of the
Western form and ls thus shown to be a late addition. Itis evidently
written by an Eastern physician who (see p. 66¹⁶) is familiar with
Bedawin and ascetics. He holds by the doctrine of humours, but
does not even name them.

Section k. de reginn'ne sanitatis. This, with the following section l}
de calore naturali, form the 12th ‘gate’ of our Western⁴form, as
translated into Hebrew, and the beginning of Discourse VII, οη
medicine of the Arabic text. This is the tract that with part of the
introduction of Yulmnna ibn al-Batrik was translated by Johannes
Hispalensis. The two sections are, however, separated in the Eastern ’
Arabic text by sections de divisione corporis, and foods, water, and
