the tract on Justice. A good example is BN. fonds latin 6756 (in an
Italian or Avignon hand of the early fourteenth century) which shows
a close correspondence with the original order. Others of less impon
tance are B.M. 12 D. iii, 12 C. vi. In many cases the list of contents
shows the original order while the text itself is in the revised form.

No printed Latin texts correspond exactly with the full Vulgate
text, though some of the earlier translations were made from it.

BAcon's EDITION.

vEncouraged by the fact that changes had already been made in the
text, Bacon set himself the task of further rearrangement, dividing it
into four parts of approximately equal length instead of the ten of his
author, and inserting several paragraphs as well as transforming the
⁵ chapter headings, without giving any indication of the changes he had
made. Some of these insertions may indeed have been brought up
into the text by copyists inserting glosses, but others are unmistakably
inserted by him. The chapter he adds most to is that on the fiesh of
vipers as a medicine, extracted from Avicenna. The section of the
theory of magio, ‘O Alexander jam scivisti’ (pp. 157—63)‚ which in
the Arabic begins the tenth discourse, is placed by him at the end of
his third part: in the ordinary Latin MS. text it is rhoved as a whole,
with the sections on alchemy and the properties of stones and plants
which follow it, to the end of the second book.

A rather remarkable thing is that Bacon calls the work (pp. 2 5, 172)
Liber Decem Scienciarum—a name otherwise unknown in Latin, but
with Arabic authority. In the Universal History ofEl-Makin (Budge,
Alexander, ii. 382) we find:

⁴ Now there are some who say that Aristotle the sage, the teacher
of Alexander, taught the ten sciences of the earth and established them,
and that he composed many treatises on the healing of the body
besides other well-known books. And he compiled for Alexander
a work, which we have mentioned in a previous place, and entitled
it “The Book of the Knowledge of the Laws of Destiny''‚ and in it the
seience of talismans and the art of astrology, and he drew therein
magical figures which were to be used for frightening and terrifying
men and he further gave instructions, . . '

With the exception of the three or four late copies of this manu-
script Bacon’s edition had no influence on the text of the Secretum.
