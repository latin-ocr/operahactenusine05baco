Lune, while the Emerald Table (pp. 115-17) is quoted by Albertus,
de mz'neralt'bus.

In his dedication Philip states that the book was found at Antioch.
Some doubt has been thrown on this remark, but without reason:
Antioch was a very likely place for the free exchange of thought
between Christians and Mohammedans at the time.

Though we know nothing certain of Guido or Philip we have some
materials for conjecture. The translation is dedicated in the Vulgate
MSS. ‘ Guidoni Vere de Valencia, civitatis metropolis glorioso ponti-
fici ', a form which is obviously incomplete, and accordingly soon
passed intoq‘ civitatis tripolitani glorioso pontifici’. Bacon supplies
in his title the name of the archiepiscopal see as Napolis, i. e. Naples.
If this is true, Guido could only have been archbishop between 1247
and 1253. ' ’

Philip, who had been in his service and was now separated from
him, is called in the body of the work in several early manuscripts
‘Philippus Tripolitanus '‚ e. g. ‘Incipit liber quartus. Transtulit
magister Philippus Tripolitanus de forma justitia' (BN. fonds latin
6584, 11119 &c.). We know of a Philip of Tripoli who was canon
of Byblos 1243—8, chaplain of Hugo, Cardinal of St. Sabine, canon of
Tyre, canon of Tripoli (provision of 1243, not filled 1248), elected to
see of Tyre Oct. 26, 1250, but declined it in favour of N. cantor of
Tripoli ‘our chamberlain': licence 1251, Jan. 15 to keep all offices
together in Tyre, Sydon, and Tripoli after electiori of N. to Tyre.
Chaplain of Innocent IV March 8, 1251.

We get hints in a brief of 1243 as to the business that may have
taken Philip to Antioch : the Bishop of Tripoli, who had never
fathomed ‘the mysteries of Donatus and Cato '‚ having been excom—
municated and interdicted by the patriarch of Antioch. We have no
hint as to any connexion of a Guido de Vere with Valence or
Valencia. He may possibly have belonged to the Lincolnshire
Anglo·Norrnan family of de Vere, in which Guido was a family
name. I can find no other Vere family in Western Europe in which
Guido was a family name. In this one we meet a Guy de Vere in
the 1131 Pipe Roll, another in 1173 supporting Henry II against his
sonS, in 1 180 paying a fine for not destroying a castle in Lincolnshire‚
. in 1 199 a benefactor of the Hospitallers‚ in 1204 a benefactor of Selby
Abbey, and another in 1233 as a tenant of Ranulf de Blundeville,
’Earl of Chester. The persistence of the name in the family for
a century almost creates a probability that our Guido de Vere was
