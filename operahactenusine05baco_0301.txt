Useful information derived from certain of the learned on the
authority of the Imam (may God accept him) : he said there can
be no state without men <soldiers), and no men without wealth,
and no wealth without subjects, and no people without justice,
and no justice without law, which is the life of the state.

And in the above figure all' t'he d'ivisions are connected with
one another: state is a power established by custom, custom is
a weapon wielded by the king, the king is an arm supported by
the army, the army is composed of soldiers employed by wealth,
wealth is subsistence collected by the subjects, the subjects are
composed of servants subjugated by justice, justice is civilization
and well-being of the world, the world is the ground on which is
based the foundation of state.³
