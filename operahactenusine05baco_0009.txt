PREFACE

THE issue of this series has been interrupted by the war,
and this volume has been interpolated‚ for 'several reason5‚
somewhat out of its proper place in the order of Bacon’s
unpublished work, partly out of a consideration of the great
importance of the text on which he comments, and partly on
account of its influence on his whole work. Mediaeval students
will be glad to learn that the publication os the whole of
Bacon's work 'now seems assured.

As before, I have to acknowledge the ready assistance of
mediaeval scholam, among them Prof. A. G. Little, Mr. J. P.
Gilson‚ Dr. Cowley, Dr. Henry Braffley, the Librarian of the
Grand-Ducal Library of Saxe-Gotha, who forwarded for study
two Arabic MSS. of the =S'ecrgaez‘um secretorum, happily re—
turned to him in safety, Mrs. Henry Dakyns‚ who many years
ago copied out and prepared the text of Le Secre de Secres
with a view to joint publication elsewhere, to the Committee
of the Bacon Commemoration of⁸1914, who have materially
assisted in the preparation of this volume, and to others
named in the Introduction.
