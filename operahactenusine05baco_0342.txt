a modis creaturarum : in orationibus et sacrificiis. nam onmia ista non

9⁵. Artephius. Several tracts are extant under this name, including
the De secretis naturae, but nothing preserving the legend alluded to
here and elsewhere (23¹⁸; Brewer, 540, 5463 Op. Maj. ii. 209).

20¹⁰. dignitatibus. The passage in the Op. Mas. (i. 261) and Meta-
plzysics (p. 49) is much better and more correct. The passage is taken,
and modified, from Grosseteste’s De impressionibus aeris (ed. Baur,
p. 43), which contains a good table of the ·terrns or limits and of the
facies or decans. There are three equal decans or facies in each sign
and five unequal terms orlirnits. C-rosseteste gives the· term twice the
influence of the decan, Bacon it will be seen reverses it. The domus of
a planet is the sign in which it was created :q Sol in Leo, Luna in· Can-

cer, Saturn in Capricorn, Jupiter in Sagittarius, Mars in· Aries, Venus ι

in Libra, Mercury in Virgo. The house with respect to the earth is
found by dividing the vertical circle passing through the zenith and
nadir into twelve parts, that beginning at the eastern horizon being the
first house. The position of the signs and planets in these houses will
of course vary from moment to moment.

24⁸. in Sciencia Experimentali alibi scripsimus. See Cp. Mas.
ii. 209. Obviously this part of the Opus Majus was written before the
introduction.

24⁹. vidimus. Compare this passage with that just referred to, and
Brewer‚ p. 539. But perhaps ‘ vidimus ’ is used in a general sense.

36²⁵. In Sanguinetti's extracts from Ibn Abi Osaibi’ah, this is
attributed to AEsculapius. Galen says: ‘ Le Dieu supreme a revehi a
Esculape ce qui suit: Tu es plus digne que je t'appelle un ange qu’un
homme ' (som-nal Asiatique (1853), iv. 184). There is a passage in
Galen, Suasoria ad artes oratio : ⁶ Among these we rank Socrates and
y Homer and Hippocrates and Plat0‚ and their followers‚ whom we
reverence as equal with the gods, as messengers and servants of the
gods ’, which may be the origin of this statement.

36³⁰. ‘ Hippocrate dit que Dieu a e'leve a lui Esculape dans les aits,
au milieu d’une colonne de lumiere ' (loc.cit.‚ p. 184). This is also
said by Muwaffik eddin Assad os Hermes (loc. cit., p. 188). It probably
arises from the story of Enoch, who appears in the Quran ‘as Idris.
‘ And mention in the Book Idris; verily he was a confessor, a prophet ;
and we raised him to a lofty place' (19. 58). But Idris was later
identified with Hermes, see p. 99⁶. An early reference is found in

Lactantius, lnst. i. 6. 1 ‘ Unum proferam quod est simile divino, et .

ob nimiam vetustatem et quod is (Hermes) quem nominabo ex homini-
bus in deos relatus est)
