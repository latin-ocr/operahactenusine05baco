names and predictions therefrom) was in the original ‘dictio decima ’,
while there is no other trace of geomancy in any Latin text. (2)
Bacon expressly tells us that most valuable sections of the text had
been removed by dunderheads. (3) Though all the texts are
Vulgate yet in some MSS. the chapter headings at the beginning
show the Arabic order, e. g. physiognomy before justice, and the title
‘dictio decima ' in its right place, indicating that some MSS. must
have existed with that arrangement. (4) In all the best Vulgate MSS.
the proper ending of the (original) tenth book is preserved, and may
be found at the end of Book II before Justice.

All the Latin MSS. are then of one main variety. They differ
among themselves by omissions and additions, the principal additions
being a chapter ‘ de oculis ’, another from Avicenna ‘ de viperis ’, and
a note from Pliny as to the effect of the moon. Bacon's text is a
variety of the Vulgate, modified by dividing it into four books, and
adding new captions to the chapters. This text is otherwise a very
good one, but it has had no effect on the MS. tradition.

The first printed Latin texts are very much abbreviated, printed
from late fifteenth-century manuscripts. Two editions of the Vulgate
text were printed before 1500. But in that year a composite text
was printed for Achillini which had no manuscript authority. He
seems to have got hold of the Hebrew version of the Western text, or
of some early Latin version, and to have inserted its thirteenth
and last section‚ which has no relation to the Eastern text, in suitab'le
places of Philip's version. As the Achillini text is the one generally
met with, this has caused a certain amount of confusion.

Tm: SYRIAC ORIGINAL.

In the introduction to the work as we now have it we are told that
it was translated from Greek into Rumi, and from Rumi into Arabic‚
by Yuhanna ibn el-Batrik (or Ibn Yahya al-Batrik). Rumi is the
common word for Syriae, when it does not mean Greek, and Yuhanna,
who died ΑΛ). 815, was a well-known translator, physician of Α1-
Ma’mun, who is said to have rendered the Politics and the Historia
Animalium into Syriae, and the De caelo et mundo and the De
anima in epitome, with other works, into Arabic. There does not
seem anything obviously unlikely about the ‘statements that a Syrian
text has existed, and that it was translated into Arabic about the

· beginning of the ninth century by Ibn al-Batrik, while it is to be

hoped that English scholars, at any rate, have dropped the pose that ’
