is of four kinds, i. e. the four elements‚ and of those things which
are created from them, viz. the mineral, vegetable, and the animal
kingdoms. And every physical body in the universe has its proto-
type in the spiritual world, the latter being the causeof the exis·
tence of the former, and ruler over it.

Hence all physical forms are governed by their relative heavenly
bodies. This law of nature has given rise to the science of talis—
mans. These ethereal bodies are fixed in the heavenly spheres‚
and the seven governing planets reflect their forms in their own
lights‚ as the eye and polished bodies reflect the forms and images
of material objects, and thence they cast down their shadows

let thy observation be made at a time when its light is not cut by
its vicinity to the other planets‚ and its rays auspicious, if the
talisman is made for the good of anything, and otherwise if it is
prepared for the ill of any one. And Ι shall give thee an example
of it which is indispensable for thee. And Ι shall explain to thee
the method of procedure, God willing.

And know that those who are endowed with clear intellect and
good memory for acquiring knowledge, and who can find out the
hidden through that which is apparent to them, having reached
to hidden truths of this deep and mysterious science‚ they observed
extreme caution and miserliness in communicating it to others,
although it is of such a universal benefit. They did so from the

did not possess sufficient understanding for it, and because God’s
wisdom has decreed that His gifts should not be equally divided
among His creatures. But, thanks to God, thou art not one of
