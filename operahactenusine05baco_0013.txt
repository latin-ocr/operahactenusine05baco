INTRODUCTION

THE text of the Secretum Secretorwn, which is here printed as
edited by Roger Bacon with his introductory treatise and glosses, is
taken from a thirteenth—century manuscript in the Bodleian Library
from which all other existing copies of his edition appear to have
been derived. To complete the work and make it more generally
useful to students of mediaeval literature, certain passages unknown
to Bacon, but inserted by Achillini in his edition of 1501 from
a Hebrew version of the Western recension‚ bave been added,
together with a literal translation of the original Arabic made under
my supervision by Mr. Ismail Ali and edited by Mr. Fulton‚ of the
Oriental Department of the British Museum‚ who is preparing an
edition of the Arabic text. This rendering will serve as a key to the
Latin, and at the same time will show the remarkable accuracy of the
orIginal translation and the variation it has undergone.

The MS. (Tanner 116) is an English manuscript, which at one
time belonged „to Archbishop Sancroft. It is described in Hack-
man’s Catalogue thus: ‘Codex membranaceus in folio minore,
ff. 111, sec. X111 exeuntis 3 binis columnis, haud eadem manu exara-
tus 3 olim peculium Jacobi Windet, ex dono‘ Jacobi Everitti Antver-
piensiS.' It contains (1) R. Β. tractatus ad declaranda quedam
obscure dicta in libro Secreti Secretorum Aristotelis (here printed,
pp. 1-24). (2) Extracts from Opus Tertium, &c.‚ see p. 24. (3)
Secretum Secretorum (here printed, pp. 25-172). (4) Tracts by
Simon de Faversham, &c It was apparently in English hands at
the beginning of the sixteenth century, as it contains some verses in
English by Robert Dey. Later copies (almost certainly of this
manuscript) are Trinity Coll. Cambridge 1036 (fifteenth century)
Fitzwilliam Mus. Carnb. McClean 153 (fifteenth century), C.C.C.
Ox. 149 (late fourteenth‚ Dr. Dee’s copy).

A number of Bacon’s notes are incorporated in a MS. of the
Secrelum in the British Museum MS. 12 E. xv, which afterwards
belonged to Edward IV when a youth.

' The date to be assigned to Bacon's share in this work lies
between well-fixed limits. In the first place, the fact that he uses
