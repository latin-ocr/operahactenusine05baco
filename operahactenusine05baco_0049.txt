The length of the seasons is continually altering‚ and though our
calendar has been reformed to keep the equinox at its proper date,
the length of time during which the sun is north of the equator is
always greater than that when he is south of the equator. A glauce
at the table shows that the length of spring and summer together
varies between 183 and 187 days, and that of autumn and winter
from 178 to 182. Prof. H. H. Turner informs me that the maximum
difference between the two half—years is 7.788 days—7 d. 19 h.
approximately‚ and Prof. C. L. Poor of Columbia University has
calculated the true lengths of the seasons for 1250, which appear
below, with a difference of 7 d. 22 h. On the other hand, M. Charles
Nordmann of the Paris Observatoire has stated in print that towards
1250 the difference amounted to 36 days. There is evidently room
for further study of the subject. Incidentally it appears that the
solstice and the apogee coincided about 1246—7. Mr. Fotheringham
calculates that the length here given of spring was true 17 B.c.‚ of
summer A.D. 723, of autumn A.D. 89, and winter ΑΛ). 1256. The
dates of the equinoxes and solstices are approximately true for the
second century A.D.

The dates and the average lengths of the seasons given in the
following table depend on observations of varying value. A method
of interpretation seems to point to a date of observation somewhat
near that of Haly Abbas, who was not an astronomer‚ but after that
of Albategni who was. It has already been pointed outthat the
date of the equinox is incompatible with the lengths of the seasons
given.
