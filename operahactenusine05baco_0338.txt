bodies. But in order to make it more plain I must explain ’to
thee a little more regarding the properties of these vegetables.

For it is in the knowledge of the properties of things that
philosophers are distinguished from one another, as it is in the
knowledge of the action of their natures that physicians ,vie with
one another.

And I inform thee, O Alexander, that all those vegetables
which do not blossom belong to Sanum, and those which do
blossom are related to Jupiter.l Then these kinds are mixed
one with another; hence there are some which bear fruit without
blossoming as the date tree‚ which is related to Satum and the
Sun conjointly. And those that do not bear fruit but blossom,
they are related to Jupiter and Mars.

There are others which are planted, others sown, and others
grow up without either planting or sowing. Hence it is apparent
from what I have said that every vegetable possesses a property
matching the power of a planet. And the originals of those

properties are the powers that endow thern with their speeific 2

attributes as colour, taste‚ smell, and form. And the universal
soul arranges in order these properties‚ powers, and natures,
because they are its particulars. And it fixes them and sustains
thern for the time of their being. Know that there can be no
action without movement, and no knowledge without limits.

Therefore (may God lead thee to the right path !)‚ find out the
kind of vegetable which causes sickness, and the kind that removes
sickness, and the kind that creates joy, and the kind that creates
sorrow, and the one that makes one loved‚ and the one that
causes one to be despised and hated,² and the one that produces
true dreams, and the one that produces merriment, and the one
that produces sloth and langonr, and the one that destroys the
body entirely, and the one that cures it and srees it from hurtsul
poisons. And I shall explain to thee in detail so that thou
mayest understand it more clearly.

Τ he kind of vegetable that causes dignity and honour is a trec
which possesses folded leaves of a conical form. Its fruit also
resembles a cone, and its branches are green, and its smell is
