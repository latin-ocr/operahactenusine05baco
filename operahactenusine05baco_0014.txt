the method of glossing would dispose us to put it early in his career.
In the second, the fact that he alters the manuscripts before him
when they treat of the length of the year (p. 80), preferring the worse
to the better reading, shows that he had not, at the time of ¹writing
the note, arrived at the sense of the importance of accuracy in
astronomy which he entertained, say, in 1267, when he wrote the
Opus Majus. Thirdly, a number of the notes were written soon
after his return to Oxford, after a stay in Paris (pp. 34, 38). Ι am
therefore inclined to put the completion of the text and notes at

some date before 1257, when he returned to Paris. The glosses, ,

interlinear in the MS., are printed here immediately below the text as
large—print notes, “ ⁴

The introductory treatise is much later. It must be some time
after the comet of August, 1264 (p. 10³²). It must even be after
1267. On p. 3¹⁴ Bacon is very severe on ‘glomerelli nescientes
Grecum' for their confusion of ‘ matesis ’ and ‘ mathesis ’, translating
the first as ‘knowledge' and the second as ‘divination '. Unfortu-
nately he had in 1267 fallen into the same mistake (Op. Maj. i. 2 39¹⁵),
and repeated it next year (Op. Tert.‚ Brewer, p. 27⁶), though he
corrected it in his Greek Grammar (p. 1 18²), and in his Mathematics.
I am inclined to place the date of the introduction at about 1270,
especially in ¹view of Bacon⁷s remarks about a forthcoming total-
eclipse (11³²), which must refer either to that of June 13, 1276,
visible in the polar regions, or of Oct. 28, 1277, visible in East Asia,
which however did not become visible in England or F rance (unless
the passage was written before the eclipse of May 25, 1267, visible
in Italy).

The secretum Secretorum exercised so greatjtn influence on the
mental development of Roger Bacon that merely on this ground
a study of it would be interesting. From his first work to his last he
quotes it as an authority, and there can b·e no doubt that it sortified‚
if it did not create, his belief in astrology and natural magic. It
came to him and his contemporaries as an unquestioned work of '
Aristode, which must have been known to exist for over a century,
since it was quoted by Mesue, p. 273 <eleventh or twelfth century ¹)
and a portion of it was translated c. 1 135 in Spain, though Averroes
in 1177 says, in his commentary to the Ethics (Lib. X z'n fine), that
the ‘de regimine vite' had not yet come into his hands. The ,

¹ He quotes, however, only from the intrusive ‘de oculis ’, and even then not
from any text known to us.
