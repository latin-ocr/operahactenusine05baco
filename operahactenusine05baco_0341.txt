NOTES

INTRODUCTORY TREATISE

3¹⁴. glomerelli. Grammarians, Aterm (1267), used especially
of V Grammar boys at school. See Rashdall, llffecl. Universitc'es, ii.

, 555·

4²⁴. Beata scolastica? 1 take the story from the Golden Legend.
‘ It happed another day that S. Benet went to visit his sister, named
Scholastica, and as they sat at table she prayed her brother that he
would abide there all that night, but he in no wise would grant her, and
said he might not live out of his cloister. And when she saw that he
would not grant her to abide, she inclined her head and made her
prayers to our Lord‚ and anon it began to thunder and lighten, and the
air to wax dark which tofore was fair and clear, and a great rain fell
down so that for nothing he might depart . . .'

6¹⁹. titulos authenticos. A long list of these with incipits is given
in the speculum Α stronomicum of Albert. It has been suggested that
this tract was written by Bacon, but no one with an ear for style could
accept the suggestion for a moment. Bacon's other mention of them
is in the De nullitate magiae, c. 4 (Brewer, p. 532, see p. 526) and in
the Opus Tertium (p. 48, Little).

6³⁰. ungue pueri virginis carminati. See a case in Lz‘ncoln
Vz'sitations‚ vol. ii, where an abbot at Leicester is found doing this in
the fifteenth century. The shoulder blade of a ram is used in divination
all over the world, but more commonly by the cracks on it when
heated.

7⁶. geomantici. The usual method was to take three sets of odd
or even by chance three times. This gives a figure interpreted by well-
known rules‘.

7³⁵. jam incepta est a quindecim annis. If we may accept this
as referring to Richard of Cornwall‚ whose teaching was condemned at
Paris aster having been enunciated at Oxsord in 1250 (Rashdall, [emp.
Slud. Theol„ pp. 52—3)‚ the date of this introduction might be 1265.
On the other hand the error may be the Averroist doctrine of the unity
of the intellect (c. 1256), bringing the date to 1271.

8²⁴. Averoys. ‘Dicit et aliam rationem famosam quod haec fuit
causa ut lex apud eos preciperet u“t orationes eorum essent tres: aut
sacrificia: et dixit: et non invenit legislator hominibus istum numerum,
nisi ut sequeret naturam ut ista lex sit quasi sequens naturam. Dixit.
Et secundum istum numerum tenemur magnificare creatorem remotum
