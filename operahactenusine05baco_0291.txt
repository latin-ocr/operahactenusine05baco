Also avoid bleeding when Mars or Saturn is in the house of
nativity, or sacing the moon. The best time for letting blood is
the latter half of the lunar month, when its light is decreasing,
and when it is either in Libra or Scorpio, and when inauspicious
stars are not looking at it. And the worst time for that purpose
is when the moon is inauspicious in its second or eighth
house.

As for eupping, its best time is when the moon is rising and
increasing in its light, and when none of the inauspicious stars
are overlooking it, especially Mars, when the moon is in the
house of Venus, or when Venus or Jupiter are overlooking it.
But when the moon is the lord of that part of the body [where
cupping is desired], it must not be attempted.

Times of taking Medicines.

When thou wishest to take medicine, let the moon b'e in one
of the southern signs, except Capricorn, and let it be close to
Venus or Jupiter. Better still isit is in Scorpio or Pisces or in
Libra, or in the northern signs. Beware of taking medicine when
the moon is with Saturn, because it will keep the medicine in the

’ stomach. But the farther the moon is from Saturn the better it

is. But there is no harm in the conjunction of the moon with

· Mars, though it lessens the effect of the medicine. Let the pivot‘

of thy action rest with the well-being of the moon, its absence from
the inauspicious stars and its proximity to the auspicious ones. .

And now that I have finished describing physical remedies‚
I am going to mention spiritual ones, Know that mental diseases
are also amenable to treatment. But their treatment is carried
out by means of musical instruments which convey to th‘e soul,
through the sense of hearing, the harmonious sounds which are
created by the motions and contacts of the heavenly spheres in
their natural motion, which affect the right perceptions.

And when those harmonies are interpreted in human language
they gave 'rise to music which is pleasing -to the human soul‚
because the harmony of the heavenly spheres is represented in
man by the harmony of his own elements, which is the principle
. of life. Hence, when the harmony οἷέειῐῑὴῐγ music is perfect or,
