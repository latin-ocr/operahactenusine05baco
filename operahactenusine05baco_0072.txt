THE TRA‘NSLATION FROM THE ARABIC,

The value of this translation from the Arabic text, as we have
it to-day is two-sold 3 it serves as a translation of the Latin for those
readers who 'find a difficulty in accustoming themselves to it,
the corresponding pages of the Latin text being marked on the
margin, and it allows us to form an opinion of the competence
of thirteenth-century translators from the Arabic. In this case there
is no doubt thatiPhilip's translation is very'close to his text, allowing

for ornamental additions and expansions which are easily recognized. ‘

It was originally intended to mark the additions which distinguish
the Eastern from the Western forms by a difference in type, but
this intention was abandoned, and the student will find it easy to
compare the version here given with Dr. Gaster’s version of the
Hebreiv text, which is in substance the same as the Western Arabic,
the forms given in the notes as W marking the exact Western text.

To make this collection of pseud-Aristotelian letters to Alex-
ander more complete, a letter on the immortality of the soul from
the Taegius text (pp. xxiv, xxv) drawn from some unknown source,
and an English translation of a letter on Ethics from an Arabic MS.
in the British Museum have been added. These with Lippert’s
translation of the Peri Basileias will show the principal Arabic forms
which were written in rivalry with the Sea-etum secretorum.

THE ANGLO-NORMAN VERSION.

This version must have been madevery soon after the intro-
duction of the Secretum to the Western world, yet there was time for
a compound text to have been made of the Secretum and some other
treatise on health which has not yet been identified. The part not
derived from the Secretum begins at l. 1868 and ends at l. 2237.
Beyond the correction of a few scribal errors there has been no

attempt made to edit the text as it appears in the only manuscript of
it known.
